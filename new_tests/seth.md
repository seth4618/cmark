# money 6/12

an alternative distributed self-certifying web-of-trust based
currency.  I isssue seth-dollars; which have a web-of-trust (WOT)
behind them. This WOT will determine how risky seth-dollars are in
terms of whether they are transferable, etc.  For example, if my WOT
includes the person I am issuing them to, they are significantly more
likely to be accepted.  Is this a form of crypto-currency that is more
reasonable then bitcoin for example?

+ Analyze a credit for for trustworithiness.
+ track times a particular issued credit has exchanged hands - this adds to credit worthiness of issuer.
+ is there a way to be anonymous?
+ if my credit makes the rounds and then is sent back to me - it disappears.
+ if I use someone else's credit, what does that say about me?
+ does this eliminate corporate bonds?  Can they just issue credits?
+ allow contracts to be attached (a la bitcoin)
+ Can I issue a credit that has an interest rate attached?  Can it have an expiration date?  Can I demand it back (in exchange for other credits?)
+ can I use a credit from X and also back it up with my own WOT?  how does that change value of the credit
+ are different credit issuers worth different amounts or just acceptable or not?

Imagine a situation where I have credits from various companies (e.g., my paycheck from company X, payments from things I have sold on ebay).  Each has its own credit worthiness.  I want to buy something.  I can offer x units from company A, y units from company B, or z units from myself.  How are exchange rates established?  [look back to renesianse fairs where clearinghouses would settle up accounts]

I issue credit.  It is signed by me and backed by my WOT.  It might
carry an interest rate that will accrue until an agreed upon exchange
for an alternative currency.

What does it mean to back some currency - that you will redeem it at a
specified discount, or upto a certain amount of outstanding currency.

## thoughts

### privacy and trust

does privacy have a value - and is it negative?  Privacy may be
counter-productive to establishing the kind of trust needed to make
money, as a social technology, work.  Particularly if we are thinking
of how money and trust/reputation work.  If money is not backed by a
government, but is more of a distributed trust relationship privacy
may adversely effect the ability to determine of someone's credit can
be transfered to someon else and how to record the system of accounts.
(based on Felix book this would make 2 of the requirements for money
definition to fail)

### privacy and community

Does privacy work against the establishment of a community?  Why do we
need privacy?  Is it an intrinsic good?  What level is reasonable.  I
think it is good that my thoughts are private.  However, when my
thoughts become manifest - through actions and into tangible effects
and items, should they still allowed to be private?  Compare parts of
prayer allowed without a minyan and those that require a minyan.  What
made it possible for Irish economy to survive (and even grow) when
banks were closed?  The lack of privacy created by the environment of
the pub allowed peoples credit worthiness to be established.  

Is there something different between privacy and a secret?  Which
manifest thoughts should be allowed to be private?  One's diary?
One's research output?

### privacy, community, distribitutedness

Theory about overall progress in history:   
+ From concrete to virtual. 
+ From centralized to distributed.

From Dov's drash this week: from mikdash to torah.  Is this reason
judiasm survives while other sacrificial cults have disappeared.
Because judiasm somehow allowed for the transition from a centralized
organization to a decentralized one?  Of course, catholic church is a
counterexample.  Though it was post-sacrificial it is still very
centralized - at least from a dogma perspective.  On the other hand,
logistically, individual priests have a lot of autonomy.  Both
however, are based on the virtual, not physical?

Maybe the movement from central to distributed is just an outgrowth of
larger numbers of people.  At come point it is too hard to run a
system from a central point when the system gets to be too big.  Basic
physics.  Only 1 particle in 1 place at any one time.  So, as you pack
them in, there are both latency and bandwidth issues if all comm comes
from one place.

When, by necessity, a system (read community in this case) becomes
large enough there has to be more than one point of control.  Robust
systems will be those that can work without a central control.  Then
the question becomes: do the disparate parts of the system work
together, or are they going after different goals.  It would seem that
there would be a competitive advantage to those separate groups that
would work to a common goal and evolution would select those systems
which work together.  Thus, distributed systems would in the end
dominate.

### privacy because no fingerprints

Thesis: Concern with privacy today is less about privacy then it is
about no knowing who it is that has access to our "private" data.  In
other words, if all viewing of information was bilateral, then we
would be less concerned.  The inbalance between those we look in and
those being observed is relatively new.  In a village where everyone
has the same basic power and everyone knows who knows what, there was
little privacy, but it was ok.  In a country with a large centralized
government the individual citizens have less power and become
concerned (rightly so) with how much of their information is exposed.
Thus, the constitutional rights to privacy, (I.e., 1st, 3rd, 4th, and
5th ammendments) could be framed and are easy to read as ways to
insure that the power of the government is not overstepped.  It gives
some basic power to the less powerfull - the citizens.

As technology progresses there are more and more ways for a person's
information to be accessed with that persons knowledge.  As societies
grow larger the power imbalance between individuals and the group.  I
would argue that these are the two main reasons that privacy became an
issue.  With the advent of the internet some of the power that was
before only in the hands of large centralized organizations is now
possible to be mustered when individuals come together as a
distributed system with a single goal.  Further, it allows us to share
information with others and determine who is looking at our
information.  This reduces the feeling of needing privacy.

Re: Dov's drash: An individual who is tamei has what could be thought
of as a private blemish and is banned from the mikdash, the
sacrifices, even eating of the sacrifices.  That with a physical
blemish may not serve in the mikdash, but may partake of the
sacrifice.  The difference: a physical blemish is not private.  One
view of this is that a private thing is more onerous than a public
one.

### restoring balance

instead of trying to insure privacy which could be viewed as a way of
separating oneself from society, we could try and put a technology
together which binds us together in a more balanced relationship.
This would, I believe, lead to a situation where privacy concerns
became less important.  Imagine a social technology that: 
- created an abstract value with which things could be measured
- created a system of accounts, so the credits or debits of actors could be tracked
- the value itself determined the credit worthiness of credit and debits so that they could be transfered between parties

a technology that enabled trade and the establishment of community in
a distributed environment.  Where credit worthiness was established in
a distributed manner.  Where the act of accruing value also increased
the tradability of that value.  Where reciprocity was rewarded which
would increase community bonds and thus the trust needed to establish
a trading economy.

# Where Will the jobs go?

## Five Scenarios

### Replacement/Substitution

This category of job loss will come about due to a technology
eliminating a task which is still necessary to the economy.  

For example, mechanical drafting (CAD tools), home care nursing (when
robots can bath, feed, dress, etc. a patient), secretary (office
productivity tools), certain types of manufacturing (3D printers,
etc.).

### Force Multiplier/Augmentation

This category of job loss relates to tasks which remain necessary, but
where a single person can replace multiple people using technology.

For example, first responders (replace X ops on the beat with one that
operates semi-autonomous robots.  The operator provides the empathy,
common sense, and major decision making for all the robots - most of
which are just walking around observing.  As the technology gets
better this might turn into substitution, but we don't have a trend
line for it, so to be conservative we assume it will not be replaced)

### Obsolescence

This category of job loss refers to tasks which are no longer necessary in the new economy.

For example, coal miner in a solar economy or buggy whip manufactorer
after the automobile.

### Status Quo

This category of jobs remains valuable in the new economy and is not
affected by technology.  The number of positions might however
increase due to increased demand.

For example, NFL player or Clergy

### Creation

This catagory of tasks were not present in the old economy.

For example, muffler repair after the introduction of the automobile.

## Why won't all jobs be replaced?

It is our position that even in categories where substitution is the
rule of the day there will (almost) always be some humans that perform
better than technology.  For example, while most surgery might be
performed by robots some human surgeons will (with robot assistance)
be better than just a robot alone.  In other words, the technology
solution will perform the task as well as, for example, the 70%
percentile of humans.  This would eliminate 70% of the humans from the
labor force.  The top 30% of humans would continue to perform surgery.

## Why won't the 'Creation' category of jobs combined with increased demand for the 'Status Quo' category absorb all the human inputs possible?

There is no way to prove that increased demand for goods and services
that is likely to arise from increased productivity (which will drive
down prices) will not cause more jobs to be created as happened in the
first and second technology revolutions.  However, we note that the
current (third) technology revolution is already creating situations
where the marginal labor cost of production (MLCP) is approaching
zero.  As MLCP approaches zero for a particular job categories, the
increased demand for goods and services in that category will, by
definition, not cause an increase in employement.  The question then
becomes how many job categories will improvements in technology cause
MLCP to become epsilon?

We suggest that if we look at theories of multiple intelligence (e.g.,
[Gardner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences)
or [IQ,EQ,SQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_quotient)) we can
determine, by looking at trend lines in technology, which components
of "humanness" are likely to achived by technology.  Thus, as
computing power, networking, and ML&BD continue to improve purely
cognitive skills are likely to become less valuable in a human.  As
sensors and actuators and robotics improves the purely physical skills
of a human (even in unstructured environments) will become less
valuable.  Along another axis altogether, advances in 3D printing,
synthetic biology, and nanomaterials will cause job categories to
become essentially obsolete.  As energy production and usage moves
towards renewable sources and more efficienct application to the
production process the MC of using technology will decrease.

What is left for humans?  Areas which depend heavily on empathy (and
potentially common sense) will remain in the human domain.  That is
not to say that creativity will be wholly taken over by technology.
However, we already see examples of ML algorithms which appear to be
"creative."

## How to confirm this thesis

Create a multiple quotients vector for each of the
[NAICS](http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/) classifications of jobs
in the US.  (Label some, use textual descriptions of the others and
clustering, i.e., use ML to do this).

Compare the wages and number of people employed in each classification
over the past 50 years.

Compare to something like BEA's ICT deflator and the technology metric
curves we come up with and see if there is a correlation.

Does this sounds reasonable?

# Meet with Joe Gonzalez 3/16

To try and understand trends in ML & BD:

- look at harvard studies on the value of data (for companies)
- valuation of companies using big data, e.g., twitter
- look at % of decisions based on data?
- value of predictive power? What is value of increase of x% in predictive value?
- look at ATT study where they are giving people 200mb of connectivity for free (where their data is mined) versus paying a certain value of it
- valuation of twitter, uber, airbnb, etc.

# Meet with Alex Smola 3/12

Souces of data

- UGC, user generated content, There are but so many people in the world so exp growth of this likely to slow within 10 years.
- Images, video - no end in sight
- see infographic Data Never Sleeps ([2012](http://www.domo.com/learn/infographic-data-never-sleeps) and [2014](http://www.domo.com/learn/data-never-sleeps-2))
- Control will create a tipping point in how much data since it will come from machines. E.g., 1 TB from each aircraft flight just form engines is collected (and today at least pretty much thrown away)

Beware difference between unlabeled and labeled data

- labeling requires humans
- it is expensive
- e.g., imagenet.org, maybe 10m$ to label.  Speak to fayfay? tamar burg? for actual number
- Of course some data sets are self-labeling. E.g., predicting CTR for ads or control-based data?

Summary of some history:
- UCI, originally all labeled and all small
- USPS OCR dataset, early 1990s, 5k images. Labeled
- MNIST OCR dataset, later in 90s, 60K images

Look at Kaggle, they run ML competitions but don't release datasets

For NLT talk to chris dyer and look at bleu score

Another approach look at questions being asked and how they are answered.  History would start with binary classification in 60s, multi-classification in 80s, annotating sequences (hidden markov models, speech recog, NLP)


# Meet with Scott Mathews 3/11

Talked about project in general and solar energy.  

- Should look at public subsidy of solar (versus nuclear, for example) and see whether current curves are dependent on continuing this or not.  How much is being invested privately?  Compare to ITRS roadmap investment in Si manufacturing
- Is there (or should there be) an ITRS for solar?  How do we shift R&D policy? (cut back on nuclear? increase solar?  ...)
- Check out CMU electricity institute. 
  - lots of focus on renewables
  - much work on storage
  - Jay Whitikar "Local battery guy"
    - startup on batteries
    - should definitely speak to him
- ASCE, report card on infrastructure
  - Should we be thinking about what NOT to invest in maintaining?
  - how should infrastructure evolve to deal with future tech, e.g., smart grid, ...
- Sidebar: geoengineering and issues with one org/person having hand on dial and the havoc that could wreak.

# Meet with Jared Cohon

People who would be helpful and/or interested:

- Granger Morgan (past head of EPP)
- Scott Mathews (CE & EPP, Econ & Eng)
  - Life cycle analysis
  - Thinks about metrics (eps about energy)
- Jonathan Rothberg (alum, founder of synth/seq biotech company)
- Ines Azevedo
  - chairing the "pathways" workshop that is part of the 5 thurst areas of [scott institute](http://www.cmu.edu/energy/)
  - econ/eng/analyst

# Meeting with Kyunghyun 3/6

Kyunghyun is a prospective faculty candidate.  Spoke about a bunch of stuff.  Re: future of work:

- He thinks there will be dislocation, but everyone will just become a
  designer or some such.

We spoke about getting trends in ML and he was helpful.  Divide ML tasks by increasing complexity:

- Perception (E.g., image recog, character recog, text, ...)
  - modalities
  - fidelity
  - noise tolerance
- Meaning/Understanding
  - # of modalities being combined
  - How to define meaning/understanding?  Something about relationships between entities (or "labels").  So for example, if we do image recog on photos and determine a set of pixels is a person and a set of pixels is a house and "person" and "house" are just labels there is no "meaning" going on.  But, if can determine that "person" "is next to" "house" then there is meaning being done.  
  - measure by size of model and set of possible outputs?
  - image retrieval?  image labeling combined with text based recog leads to finding the right set of images.
- Actions
  - very passive example, caption generation
  - sca loop in robotics

# Meeting with mark 2/24

C-D type production functions aren't much use to us because they
assume that labor gets a fixed percentage over time.  Changing the
labor percentage makes them hard (or impossible?) to use.

Traditional measurements of economic activity, growth, etc. are based
on GDP.  This traditional measure seems to get at the quantity of
output not the quality of life.  Are there better measures that we
need to investigate.  In particular, in a post-IR3 world is GDP
meaningful as a measure of wealth, well-being, happiness, or whatever
the study of economics is supposed to measure.

Globalization is a lot like technological change, but unlike 
globalization once tech change eliminates jobs there is really nothing
you can do.  In spite of this, I wonder if we should be reading about
the effect of globalization on labor (or trade theory) to get some
insight?

As technology improves we may find ourselves in the same situation as
the horse after IR2, just not useful.  The cost a mechanical solution
just became cheaper than using a horse.  Will that occur to humans?
E.g., Driverless car makes insuring human driven cars prohibitive.
Analyzing Cat scans: Even if some doctor is willing to work for cheap
enough and provide an analysis of a cat scan for less than the machine
analysis will the doctor be good enough that I won't pay for the more
expensive machine analysis?  Will humans become similar to spam, i.e.,
an inferior good?

Is there an analogy between zero (or negative) interest rates and zero
or negative wages?  Will people pay to work?  What does this mean?
Given my thoughts on driverless cars, I believe that sometime in the
future it will actually not be legal (or very very expensive) to have
a human behind the wheel.  Will people pay for the privilege?

Is the above related to how education and training might change in
this future economy?  If we assume that technology won't replace all
jobs, in that, the technological solution is better than 90% of
humans, that leaves 10% of humans better than a technological
solution.  However, how do those 10% get enough education, training
and experience to beat the computer.  Maybe the "intern," "shadow
employee," or "paying to work" becomes the norm until one gets enough
experience to out perform the labor-less solution.

Why is IR3 different than IR1 & IR2:

In first draft of intro mark states two core arguments.  

1. "fundamental role for labor" didn't change in IR1 or IR2.  They required more education and adjustment, but people were still part of the production equation.  In other words, the marginal labor cost of production (MLCP) was significant.
2. "production was not characterized by economies of scale sufficiently pervasive as to rule out the efficiency of competitive markets."  In other words, the marginal cost of production (MCP) was significant and not every endeavor became a monopoly nor did all the wealth generated from economic activity accrue only to the entrepreneur.  **Mark: I am not sure I understand your second argument yet**

Mark, am I getting these correct?  Assuming I am, let me try and refine these as follows.  Characteristics of IR3:  

1. It drives the MLCP close to zero in many if not all areas of economic activity.
2. It drives MCP towards zero in many areas of economic activity.
3. It decentralizes activities.  The trend is to decentralize all activities from resource creation, distribution to collaboration, manufacturing, etc.  
4. It is about exponential growth.  Unlike IR1 and IR2 which were one time step-functions (with fill-in as the technology follow-ons and complements came online) IR3 is characterized by exponential growth---only now are we getting close to the knee in the curve.
5. It is horizontal, not vertical.  By some argument you could say that IR1 and IR2 had direct impact on one area of activity---energy production and use.  IR3 is different in that the technology being created affects all areas of human activity.  

Outcomes of the above:  

1. The neoclassical feedback loop no longer functions and there is no increase in labor (E.g., Say's law doesn't apply)
2. Neoclassical competition becomes moot as marginal cost goes to zero, marginal price goes to zero and there is no incentive to invest in a new business.  How do we work Schumpeter into this?
3. Decentralization leads to activities becoming more distributed in space and time.  This reduces barriers to globalization and creates new categories of production, e.g., prosumers (a la Rifkin).
4. Exponential growth is deceiving and many of the technologies that are part of IR3 seem to be having a small effect on the economy.  (This could be part of the explanation of Solow's famous 1987 quote "We can see the computers everywhere except in the productivity statistics.”)  However, as they pass the knee of the curve they may outstrip our ability to respond in a timely and smooth fashion.
5. The pervasive nature of IR3 means that creative destruction does not create new jobs as it creates new tasks.

A (The?) set of Technologies that will have the most important impact in IR3 can be broken down into four basic areas:

- Energy: How we get the inputs and how we apply them to useful work.
- Manufacturing: How we make artifacts, including, but not limited to: food, medicine, manufactured goods, houses, cars, ...
- Computation/Communication/Cognition: Information management in a broad sense
- Interactions with the Physical World

Energy: **Solar power** is the IR3 technology most like IR1 and IR2.  It
will allow us to price in traditional externalizes associated with
fossil fuels.  Trends indicate that we will have enough installed
solar power to cover US needs by 2030!  Prices per watt are dropping
exponentially and in some markets are competitive fossil fuels.
Installed base is increasing exponentially as well.  Three big
barriers to a solar powered economy are  

- the drag that comes from a multi-trillion dollar investment in fossil fuels.  Associated with this is the infrastructure investment that will be needed to make solar useful for transportation (e.g., electric charging stations) and to make the grid smart enough to deal with the duck curve.
- batteries (need significantly more energy-density/$ and this has been a very linear curve)
- lossless (or very little loss) transmission lines (to transport power from sunny regions to sunless regions)

Manufacturing: Traditionally manufacturing has two main components:
fabrication and assembly.  There are fundamental limits to assembly
that (I think we can prove) limit advances in assembly in terms of
precision, speed, and cost.  The main (that I know of) manufacturing
activity without assembly is computer chips and there we see
exponential growth.  The advent of **3D printers**, **synthetic
biology**, and **nanotechnology** are the future of manufacturing
without the need for assembly.

Computation/communication/Cognition: Advances in
**computation**/$-sec-watt, **networking**, and **Machine Learning
with Big Data** will continue to advance exponentially for the near
future.

Interactions with the Physical World: Advances in
**sensors/actuators** and **robotics** will allow non-human based
technology to more easily interact with physical world.  


# Krugman op-ed 2/23/2015

I generally agree with his sentiment, however, I take issue with:

- general productivity has slowed.  
  I am working on a theory/model that supports this historically, and
  certainly is my belief about increased exponential growth coming in
  the future vis a. vis
  - new manufacturing technologies which do NOT involve assembly
    (Moore's law, synthetic biology, and 3D printing)
  - 100% renewable energy economy within 25 years!  (the numbers
    predict 15 years, but of course there will be inertia due to
    infrastructure investment, dragging of the feel of big oil (with
    ore than 1T$ of investment), etc.
  - machine learning and big data (which operate in opposition to
    diminishing returns, e.g., the more you have the "even more" you
    get.

- and other stuff, but we talked.  


# [Accounting for growth: The role of physical work](bib/aw05.html)

## Questions:

P. 2:

> **The generic positive feedback cycle**, in economics, operates as
  follows: cheaper resource inputs, due to discoveries, economies of
  scale and experience (or learning-by-doing) enable tangible goods
  and intangible services to be produced and delivered at ever lower
  cost. This is another way of saying that **resource flows are
  productive,**

How is "The generic positive feedback cycle" == "resource flows are
productive"?

> Since demand for final goods and services necessarily corresponds to
  the **sum of factor payments**, most of which go back to labor as wages
  and salaries, it follows that wages of labor tend to increase as
  output rises.

What is "sum of factor payments"?

> This, in turn, **stimulates the further substitution of natural
  resources**, especially fossil fuels, and mechanical power produced
  from resource inputs, for human (and animal) labor. This continuing
  substitution drives further increases in scale, experience, learning
  and still lower costs.

Not sure I understand the "substitution" issue above?

P 3.

> the true relationship between capital and output is one of mutual
dependence, but with a **time lag between the output level and the
stock levels.** ... The potential labor supply responds through
demographic feedbacks over an even longer time frame, ... On the other
hand, ... exergy service (useful work) consumption levels respond
rather quickly to economic conditions (via prices), whereas the
**forward impact of changes in prices on demand – up or down – driven by
technological improvements and/or resource scarcity lags by several
years.**

I don't understand the "forward impact" stuff above.

> the economic system should be understood as a **sequential materials
processing system**, converting raw materials (and fuels) by stages into
final products and services.

Is this just the obvious, i.e., to be read literally?

> The existence of (possibly lagged) feedbacks from downstream sectors
  to upstream sectors is understood. Capital services constitute one
  such lagged feedback. Exergy services can be regarded as a generic
  intermediate with both feedback and feed-forward.

What is downstream? what is upstream?

P. 4

> our view of **growth dynamics** as a **feedback cycle**

What are the above terms supposed to mean?

P. 5

> However electric motors are not prime movers, because electricity is
generated by some other prime mover, usually a steam or gas turbine.

Does this change when solar PV is considered?

P. 8

> key assumptions of the standard theory, as set forth by Robert
  Solow, namely that marginal factor productivity can safely be
  equated with factor share in the national accounts.  This simplistic
  assumption is particularly convenient for models based on
  Cobb-Douglas production functions. 

- What does "marginal factor productivity" mean?
- what is a "factor share"?
- What is a "factor share in the national account"?
- Why is assumption simplistic?  
- What is Cobb-Douglas production function

> Payments to extractive resource owners (excluding farms) are hidden
in the capital accounts, and they constitute a very small proportion–
perhaps 3-4 percent – of GDP. This implies that resource productivity
must be correspondingly small in comparison with labor or capital
productivity. This has been a major **source of confusion** and
misdirected effort in the past.

Why a major source of confusion?

p. 9

> the identification of **marginal factor productivities** with **factor
shares** in the national accounts is based on an oversimplification of
the **neoclassical theory of optimal income allocation**. 

- marginal factor productivities?
- factor shares?
- neoclassical theory of optimal income allocation

> If labor and capital are the only two factors of production,
neoclassical theory implies that the productivity of a factor of
production must be proportional to the share of that factor in the
national income.

Why? (Maybe read Mankiw 1997)

> In the simple **single sector model** used to `prove’ the relationship
between factor productivity and factor payments, this crucial fact is
neglected.

- Why? (Where "this" is that intermediates are ignored for labor and capital.)
- What is a "single sector model"?

P. 10

> There are two mathematical conditions that a production function
must satisfy to be economically realistic. One is **the condition of
constant (or nearly constant) returns to scale**.  This implies that the
function should be a first order homogeneous function of its variables
(known as the Euler condition). **The other requirement is that the
logarithmic derivatives (marginal productivities) of the factor
variables should be non-negative** – at least on average – throughout
the entire time period (1900-1998).

Why?

P. 18

> We conjecture that a kind of phase-change or structural shift took
place at that time, triggered perhaps by the so-called energy crisis,
precipitated by the OPEC blockade. Higher energy prices induced
significant investments in energy conservation and systems
optimization.  For instance, the CAFE standards for automobile fuel
economy, introduced in the late 1970s, forced US motor vehicle
manufacturers to redesign their vehicles. The result was to double the
vehicle miles obtained from a unit of motor fuel in the US between
1970 and 1989.

Isn't the above taken into account by U? (as defined on page 12. See eqn 2a & b)

P. 19

What is "Elas" The Y-axis on the figure?

## Summary

Ayres & Warr Paper in 2005 which develops a theory of economic growth
that includes three components: capital, labor, and physical work (aka
exergy).  They note that energy can be seen as an intermediate product
of the economy, but dismiss it as they note that capital and labor are
as well.  They note how exergy is different than capital and labor
because it is consumed during production whereas capital and labor are
_cumulable_.

History of economics could be read as a story of decreasing costs of
energy delivered at point of use.  (From human labor->animal
labor->wind/water power->fossil fuels (e.g., steam->electric)).

> _Exergy_ is the correct thermodynamic term for `available energy’ or
`useful energy’, or energy capable of performing mechanical, chemical
or thermal work.  

Terms:

- Exergy is different from Energy (which is conserved) in that exergy
  is dissipated in all transformation processes.
- The measure of exergy destruction is entropy.  
- Exergy is "maximum work that could theoretically be done by a system
  as it approaches thermodynamic equilibrium with its surroundings,
  reversibly."
- potential work is exergy
- conversion efficiency is amount of actual work output from a given exergy input
- exergy measured in energy units and exergy values similar to
  enthalpy for all original fuels.
- exergy can also be measured for many products, e.g., ag, industrial
  materials, minerals, etc.

physical work:  
- mechanical
- electrical
- chemical

Or,  
- muscles
- heat engines (e.g., water/wind)
- chemical

Classify Fuels:

- fuel for muscle work (food/feed):
   - human muscle (basically none by 1900, so ignore)
   - animal (horses/mules, etc.)  significant til 1930s.  thermodynamic efficiency about 4%.
- fuel for prime movers to do mechanical work
  - fuel to make electricity
  - fuel to move things
- fuel used to generate heat (for chemical processes, space heat, domestic)  lighting special case of heating.

Exergy conversion efficiency (for all but muscle work) increasing from 1900-2000.  Electricity in particular.
![Conversion efficiency](stuff/aw05-fig1.png)

The basic conclusion is that to the 1970s there is no need for a
residual to explain growth.  It comes from labor, capital, and exergy.
From 1970-2000 growth outstrips these and they suggest this could be
because of improved energy conservation (post 73 oil shock) or ICT.

Of note is that medical advances do not appear to contribute to
growth.  This begs the question as to whether or not growth as defined
by GDP is really a good metric.  lower infant mortality doesn't effect
quantity of output, but does effect quality of life.  **So do we need
to look into alternative measures to really understand how we should
"allocate resources to satisfy their needs and wants."

Amartya Sen in his book "On Ethics and Economics":
> The study of economics, though related immediately to the pursuit of
wealth, is at a deeper level linked up with other studies, involving
the assessment and enhancement of more basic goals.

> ...

> In particular, it is worth noting here that in this approach there
are two central issues that are particularly foundational for
economics.  First, there is the problem of human motivation related to
the broadly ethical question ‘How should one live?’ ... The second
issue concern the judgment of social achievement.  Aristotle related
this to the end of achieving ‘the good for man’, but noted some
specially aggregative features in the exercise: ‘though it is
worthwhile to attain the end merely for on e man, it is finer and more
godlike to attain it for a nation or for city-states’ (Nicomachean
Ethics, 1.2; Ross 1980, p. 2).  This ‘ethics-related view of social
achievement’ cannot stop the evaluation short at some arbitrary point
like satisfying ‘efficiency’.  The assessment has to be more fully
ethical, and take a broader view of ‘the good’.

In summary:
> Therefore, an inquiry into the historical evolution of economics suggests that its purpose is to answer the question “how should one live” which can be split into finding scientific approach to understanding the ways in which how individuals and societies choose to allocate scarce  productive resources among competing alternative uses and to distribute  the products from these uses among the members of the society (engineering approach) and in fair and just manner (ethics approach). As pointed out before that modern economics heavily deals only with the engineering approach.[What is the purpose of economics?](http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-purpose-of-economics)

## Thoughts and Comments

Can one go a step further (than A&W05) and try and come up with an
economic theory of growth which has as inputs only one item:
information.  "Natural resources -> products" is a matter of reducing
entropy, increasing information content.  Energy is just another form
of information, or rather potential information, i.e., energy added to
a system organizes the system aka adds information.  Labor has several
information components: information content of workers (e.g.,
knowledge), information they add to system.  Capital likewise.  Very
footloose and fancy free here, but if we could boil down the system to
information we might be able to say something about fundamental
limits.


# Thoughts on assembly and fabrication

I should write something up about the differences between traditional
manufacturing and chip manufacturing to say something about why I
think the exponentials found in things like Moore's Law will start
applying to the rest of society when we have 3d printers and synthetic
biology for example.

# Reading [Is U.S. Economic Growth Over? ..., Gordon](bib/gordon12.html)

## Summary

Unusual growth seen in 1890-1972 was from the one-shot event of that
comes from IR2 (electricity, running water, internal combustion, ...)
and that post 1972 growth slows and will **continue to slow**.  I.e.,
IR3 is not going to have much effect.

Claims:   
- Solow's claim that growth continue unabated is false.
- prior to 1750 no real growth
- Economic growth reached peak in mid 1900s and will continue to decline
- To understand growth post-1750
  - IR1 (1750-1830) invents steam engine, cotton spinning, railroads
  - IR2 (1870-1900) invents electricity, internal combustion, indoor plumbing
  - Took 100 years to reap benefits of IR1 and IR2, i.e., IR2 still percolating through economy in 1950-70s (e.g., aircond, interstate highway, ...)
  - Post 1970 slower growth because IR2 run its course.
- IR3 starts in 1960 with computer and internet and reaches climax in late 90s.
- since 2000s advances in IT "do not fundamentally change labor productivity or the standard of living in the way that electric light, motor cars, or indoor plumbing changed it."
- Innovation is step-wise followed by incremental improvements til done.  For IR1&2, lasted 100 years.  IR3 is already done and not as big (diminishing returns?), e.g., no more changes to speed of travel, temp control of internal spaces, urbanization.
- 6 "headwinds" will slowdown future growth: end to “demographic dividend;” rising inequality; factor price equalization due to globalization and Internet; educational problems (high cost, low performance); environmental regulations+taxes; overhand of debt (consumer & govt)

## Notes and Questions

example of no more economic growth is transport speed.  From 1830
(animals/sail) to 1958 (airplanes) increased.  No more.  **ignores
downloadable goods (for freight) and virtual presense (for people).**
Other "one-time" events are listed.  And, thus, they conclude:
"economic growth may not be a continuous long-run process that lasts
forever."

Impact of IR1 (steam/railroad) took 150 years to be fully felt.  IR2
has most effect on standard of living (electric light, internal
combustion, water, telephone, phonograph, motion pictures).  benefits
include many subsidiary/complementary inventions all accomplished by
1929.  Additional follow-up not felt til 1970.  IR3 started in 1960s
(even if most want to start it with Web in 1995).  Result is ![Fig 1](stuff/gordon12-fig1.png).

**Where is the printing press on this graph?  No growth from that??**
  In england first printing press introduced in 1476 and not many
  printers or productions until late 1500s..[The Introduction of
  Printing into England and the Early Work of the
  Press.](http://www.bartleby.com/212/1302.html).

> Eventually in the 1930s and 1940s sulfa and antibiotics were
invented, but by then life expectancy had turned a decisive
corner. Little known is the fact that the annual rate of improvement
of life expectancy in the first half of the 20 th century was three
times as fast as in the last half. Within one century by 1970 life had
been utterly changed. The interstate highway system was almost
completed. Air conditioning was universal in commerce and widespread
in residential homes. Air travel by 1970 had been completely converted
to jets with no further increase in speed. Consumer appliances were
universal in the United States, with only the microwave oven still
waiting to be invented and diffused.

> _A common feature of this innovative revolution was that many of the
improvements could only happen once._

IR3 also had some one time benefits, now not much more to get.![fig4](stuff/gordon12-fig4.png)

> In 1987 Robert M. Solow posed his famous paradox, “We can see the
computers everywhere except in the productivity statistics.”

> These innovations [cell phone, ipod, ipad, ...] were
enthusiastically adopted, but they provided new opportunities for
consumption on the job and in leisure hours rather than a continuation
of the historical tradition of replacing human labor with machines.

**maybe measure of productivity is wrong?  If I consume or make stuff
  on my computer and distribute it for free, where do we measure
  productivity?  If blogs replace newspapers and I don't charge for
  it, how is it measured?**

**In re: transportation.  driverless car.  Might take just as long,
  but fewer deaths, fewer injuries, and more real time (since you can
  do other things while traveling.  How do you measure this?**

6 headwinds:

- demographic dividend: woman already moved to labor force. Now
  baby-boomers retiring.  Thus, hours/capita decreasing.  And, thus,
  output/capita grows more slowly than productivity/capita.
- educational problems (high cost, low performance of
  students). educational attainment peaked 20 years ago.
- environmental regulations+taxes: carbon pollution.  (**What about solar?**)

# [Rebutal to headwinds paper](bib/gordon14.html)

## Summary

Assume innovation continues without slowing down, still growth of
GDP/capita will be closer to 0.2% for most people, then the 2% we saw
in early-mid 1900s.  4 headwinds make this true: Demography
(baby-bomers retiring and exit from labor force of prime-age adults),
Education attainment will continue to fall, Inequality will continue
to rise, and an increase of Debt to GDP.  The result:

> The 2012 paper, and even more this paper, are careful to distinguish
forecast economy-wide productivity growth of 1.3 percent per year,
output per capita for the total population of 0.9 percent per year,
income per capita of the bottom 99% of the income distribution of 0.4%
per year, and the disposable income (adjusting for faster tax growth
and slower transfer growth) of 0.2 percent for the bottom 99%

## Notes and Questions

He addresses some of my questions about earlier paper.  IN particular:  
- predicting future innovation
- "official measures of real GDP understate the consumer surplus
provided by free entertainment and information available on the
internet." His claim is this has always been true.  (**Really?**)
- "They fail to relate the “exponential growth of Moore’s Law” to the
reality that the economy’s productivity performance for almost 10
years since 2004 shows no evidence of any any stimulus provided by the
explosion of big data or invention of smart phones and tablets. Why
should this be surprising? Marginal cost equals marginal benefit, and
as electronic data becomes costless, its marginal benefit quickly
approaches zero."  (**So how do we measure it?**)

4 headwinds:  
- demography which will reduce hours worked/capita
- education which reduces output/hour
- inequality which transfers share of growth/capita from 99% to the top 1%.
- debt? (implies increased taxes and reduced transfer payments) which
  reduces disposable income

Fig 2: summarizes growth from 1891-2013 into four periods:  
![Fig2](stuff/gordon14-f2.png)
- 1891-1972: high growth and reduced hours/capita
- 1972-1996: medium growth with increased hours/capita (from women and baby-boomers)
- 1996-2004: high growth and reduced hours/capita
- 2004-2013: low growth and reduced hours/capita

Definition [Procyclical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procyclical_and_countercyclical) is something that correlates with the business cycle.

P 6-7 he discusses the labor force demographics and the startling
decline from 1996-2013. He returns to that in section 3.1 (p.8-9).
**I would sort of like to see the number from 1996-2008**

Education.  From 1890-1970, educational attainment increased 0.8 per
decade with a contribution to overall productivity of 0.35% per
year. (Goldin&Katz,2008).  For many reasons this has and will slow
down.  Jorgenson and others suggest -0.27% growth per year from poorer
educational attainment.

Inequality.  Bad and getting worse. "Charles Murray’s Coming Apart
(2012) documents the decline of every relevant social indicator for
the bottom third of the white population."

> Starting from the 2.0 percent annual growth rate of real per-capita
GDP between 1891 and 2007, we have now subtracted 0.3 percentage
points for demography, 0.2 for education, 0.5 for inequality, and 0.2
for future fiscal corrections. This brings the total down to 0.8
percent even though no mention has yet been made of innovation or
productivity growth. These four headwinds alone are sufficient to cut
likely future U. S. economic growth by more than half, again with the
careful qualification that this future projection refers to the
disposable income of the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution,
not the average per-capita income of the nation as a whole.

Globalization discussed 

Energy/Environment.  He makes some wierd
conclusions, e.g., "Future carbon taxes and direct regulatory
inventions like the CAFÉ fuel-economy standards will divert investment
from true innovations into research that has the sole purpose of
improving energy efficiency and fuel economy."

section 5 discusses innovation.
Some ridiculous claims:
> The boom of the late 1990s was driven by an unprecedented and never-
repeated rate of decline in the price of computer speed and memory
(see Figure 10 below), and a never-since matched surge in the share of
GDP devoted to information and communication technology (ICT)
investment. The ICT share in GDP declined along with the stock market
in 2000-2002

> It is conventional in growth accounting to subdivide the observed
growth in output per hour into the separate contributions of capital
deepening, improvements in capital quality, improvements in labor
quality through education and training, and a residual term called
“total factor productivity” (TFP), sometimes described as “a measure
of our ignorance.”

Claim: Capital deepening and capital quality are endogenous to
innovation.  
![Growth rate expected for bottom 99%](stuff/gordon14-f7.png)

IR#2 broad, deep and not to be repeated.  E.g., in 1879 inventions of
electricity, internal combustion engine, and wireless transmission.
From 0 cars/household in 1900 to 89% have them in 1929! etc. etc.  

Talk about short sighted:

> Two criteria help to capture the uniqueness of IR#2. First,
something cannot be more than 100 percent of itself. The years
1890-1930 in urban America witnessed almost 100 percent of urban
housing units connected to electricity, gas, telephone, water and
sewer connections.  The diffusion of electric household appliances
into the American household had reached nearly 100 percent by
1970. The percentage ratio of motor vehicles to the number of
households had reached 90 percent by 1929. Productivity was enhanced
by the transition from farm to city, which was largely complete by the
early postwar years, and the percentage of urban vs. rural cannot
exceed 100 percent.  

> The second criteria is that some indicators
cannot go below zero. Most important was the decline in the variance
of indoor temperature between winter and summer, from a large number
to nearly zero as central heating and air condition became
pervasive. Infant mortality during 1900-1950 fell from 20 percent
almost to zero. Fatality rates among employees in the railroad,
mining, and manufacturing industries fell rapidly and death rates from
auto accidents declined by a factor of at least 15 in the 20th
century.

> [Joel Moykr] assumes that an instrument is necessary for an
outcome. As an example, it would have been impossible for Pasteur to
discover his germ theory of disease if Joseph A. Lister had not
invented the achromatic-lens microscope in the 1820s.

Long critique of Brynjolfsson-McAfee's Second machine age type thinking.
> They remind us Moore’s Law that predicts endless exponential growth
of the performance capability of computer chips, without recognizing
that the translation from Moore’s Law to the performance-price
behavior of ICT equipment peaked in 1998 and has declined ever
since. The price of ICT equipment relative to its performance, instead
of declining at 15 percent per year as in 1998, has steadily retreated
in the rate of decline until in 2012 it barely declined at all. (see
Figure 10 below).

![Figure 10](stuff/gordon14-f10.png)

He then dismisses innovation in four areas:  
- medical/pharma advances: I won't bother to quote his ridiculous
  statements. But he ignores personal genomics, synthetic biology, and
  advances in simulation.

- small robots, AI, and 3D printing: his claim is robots introduced by
  GM in 1961, so what else is new?  He dismisses 3D printing as "is a
  small deal best suited for one-off customized operations".  says
  nothing about AI.

- Big Data.  "One thing is clear – as the cost of data bytes reaches
zero, so the ratio of GDP to data bytes reaches zero as well. There is
no longer any connection between Moore’s Law or the growth of data
with the growth rates of two of the most most important ratios of the
economy: output per capita and output per hour."  Wow!  He misses point of big data completely relegating it soley to "marketing purposes"

> The quantity of electronic data has been rising exponentially for
decades. But diminishing returns have set in. The sharp slowdown in
productivity growth in recent years has overlapped with the
introduction of smart phones and ipads, which consume huge amounts of
data. These sources of innovation have disappointed in what counts,
their ability to boost output per hour in the American economy.

The above misses on two points:  
- with big data it might be the opposite of diminishing returns
  is it really output/hour in the economy the thing that counts?
- driverless cars: suggests no effect on individuals and due to having
  to load and unload trucks worthless for commercial trucks.

Lots of his conclusions rest on figure 10, which suggests that the
price drop per op/sec of ICT equipment was greatest in the late 90s
and is now 0!

## Email with Gordon

From Me:
> Dear Prof Gordon:

> I have read the original paper and the rebuttal paper with great interest.  If I read them correctly, then there are two themes.  First, that productivity will slow down due to the 4 (or 6) headwinds and independent of any change in the rate of innovation.  Second, that innovation is also slowing down.  In trying to understand this second theme I am struck by Fig 10 (on page 37) of you paper.

# Slowdown in productivity towards the end of the 20th century?

There was a significant slow down of productivity towards the end of
the last century.  I have not seen any really good explainations for
it.  If our thesis is correct IT should have continued boosting
productivity.  However, there are other factors.  In particular,
energy and communication.  The slowdown in productivity starts in the
1970s.  This coincides with the oil shock.  Also, there were
essentially no advances in communication until cell phones (in the
90s?).  In fact, in the US, the it wasn't really until the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 that we had competition with phone
service and cell phones were still basically monopolistic until the
late 1990s (I think?).  So, the question is: was the increased cost of
energy and the lack of progress in communication sufficient to dampen
the overall productivity?  Has anyone else proposed this as the reason
for the slowdown?  Can we get some data about energy prices and
overall eceonomic productivity?  how does Communication
speeds/national bandwidth correlate with productivity?

# Reading [Return of the Solow Paradox? IT, Productivity ...](bib/aadhp14.html)

## Notes and Questions

  IT effect on productivity.

- Fig 1A, I don't understand Y Axis. (relationship between IT-intensity and the log of real ship-ments per worker)? ![Fig1A](stuff/aadhp14-fig1A.png)

- Measure of IT-intesity doesn't seem to take into account increases in IT-power/$/year. (but they claim on pages 3 & 4 this doesn't seem to matter).  I don't however follow their analysis.

## Summary

Their claim is IT is not reducing jobs.  They analyze manufacturing
sector and conclude that computer-producing sector (NAICS 334) is
where all productivity increase arised.  Other manufacturing shows no
productivity increase, esp after 1990's.

## About how to get trends in ML and Big Data

- UC Irvine data set (early ML days, used by CS)
- CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) data sets (used by stats people)
- Mark Liberman, LDC @ Penn, language data sets for speech and text (20 years of datasets)

The above are academic data sets, the ones from industry are probably better.  Find these in ML papers, e.g., see latest paper by Quoc Le from Google

Another approach: take most cited papers and look at their data set sizes (e.g., they will have the size of their training set in their paper)

May be easier to pick an area (e.g., voice recog, NPL, image recog,
etc.) and look at trends within that area in terms of data set size
and results.

## Other stuff

# from latest AAAI

> Future of Work and Leisure

The automation economy is one of the great promises of machine cognition, where humans are able to offload more and more physical tasks, and also cognitive activities to AI systems. The Keynesian prediction of the leisure society by 2030 is becoming more imminent. This is the idea that leisure time, rather than work, will characterize national lifestyles.

However, several thinkers are raising the need to redefine what is meant by work. The automation economy, possibly coupled with Guaranteed Basic Income initiatives, and an anti-scarcity mindset, could render obligation-based labor a thing of the past. There is ample room for redefining “work” as productive activity that is meaningful to one’s sense of identity and self-worth for fulfillment, self-actualization, social-belonging, status-garnering, mate-seeking, cooperation, collaboration, and meeting other needs. The “end of work” might just mean the “end of obligated work.”

# 1/30 metrics and trends

rob:

I have been thinking where it would be best for you to concentrate
over the next week or so and I think the following would be good.  We list 

computation
machine learning & big data
sensing/actuating
robotics
3D-printing
Networking
Synthetic Biology
Nanotechnology

as important areas.  (We should probably add Energy, in particular
renewable energy)

I would like to have quantitative measures of the trends in each of
these areas.  To do that we need metrics and data.  I have metrics for
some and data for a subset of those.  I would like you (or us) to
figure out the metrics we can use to indicate what the trend is and
get the data.  For example:

computation: best metric ops/sec-$-watt-cm^3 over time.  I have the

data ML&BD: metric I am using so far is data-set-size over time.  Then
to qualitatively show advances related to those data sets.  This needs
more work.  Maybe there is a better metric.  The data I have is weak
(from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html).  There must be a
better metric.  To get data probably requires looking at papers in the
top ML conferences.  I will query some friends about this.

Sensing/Actuating: This needs to be broken down into modalities to do
it correctly.  For example for 
- sensing: temperature, location, audio, video, touch-precision, ...  
- actuating: video (pixels/watt-cm^2-$), audio (freq-range/watt-cm^3-sec-$), 
  locomotion (speed/$-watt-cm^3 OR precision/$-watt-sec-cm^3)

We need to recognize the overall trend.  E.g., first GPS unit weighed
>10pounds, >1 ft^3, cost > $100,000.  Now you can get one in your
phone.  or google glass, etc. Anyway, we need exact specs.

Similarly for accelerometers, compasses (these are now in MEMS and
~mm^3 volumes and sub dollar in price.)

Is there an overall way to characterize this? OR are we stuck looking
at each modality. If we are, then we should collect that instead and
them come up with some gross metric.

robotics: Not sure what the best metric is.  First guess at a way to
attack this is: fixed versus mobile.  
- For fixed: some combination of max degrees of freedom per "arm", 
  sum of DOF over all "arms", precision/sec, and reach.  
- For mobile: m/s, localization precision, max DOF per arm

3D-printing: combination of max-print-bed, # of materials, voxel size, print speed (cm^3/sec)

Synthetic biology: Use the initial data from Rob, but extend to
current.  This does't measure the kinds of things it is doing, but it
does capture the overall possibilities.  All below should be over
time:
- base-pairs sequenced/sec-$.  
- base pairs synthesized/sec-$. 
- max-single synthesized strand
- cost to seq a single human's genome
- # of species with sequenced genomes

There are others that measure indirect effects, e.g., something from
personalized genomic medicine.

Nanotechnology: This one is the biggest mystery for me to understand
how to measure.  One option: measure the tools used on nanotech, e.g.,
AFM, STM.  Another option: # of atoms/ensemble,
atomic-placement-precision/sec, # of kinds of atoms/ensemble.  OR, we
can pick a sub-field like molecular electronics and look at metrics in
that field.

Renewable Energy: Obviously need to understand the different mechanisms (water, wind, tide, geothermal, solar) but I think the following are reasonable:
- installed watt-hours (in US? World?)
- for PV solar: watts/cm^2-$.
- Time to repay initial investment at current oil-generated power rates?

So, Do you want to pick one or more of these and start looking at
narrowing down the metric choice and gathering the data?  I am
available to talk over the weekend.  In particular, I am driving for a
few hours on Saturday early afternoon when I can talk most easily.

# 1/28 notes from 0MCS chapter 2

Fuedal Economy based on subsistence comm/energy complex.  Energy from
labor (human and animal).  No property ownership as owned by god and
"leased" to king/lords/...  In late medival period money comes into
being.  In late 1500's things begin to change by the "Enclosure
Movement" (from 16-early 19th century).  As this occurs peasants are
uprooted and become fre agents for hire in start of medieval
marketplace.

enclosure wave 1 (to hold sheep) come from:

- rising demand for food (bigger urban population) leads to inflation spiral (and fuedal lords get fixed rents)
- new textile industry creates demand for wool

enclosure wave 2: finishs transition from subsistence farming to market-directed agricultural economy between 1760-1840 as IR1 spreads.

- more demand for food.  bigger urban population
- high prices cause landlords to enclose property

Changes property rights from cinditional to exclusive ownership.
Similarly, labor becomes another form of property that can be governed
by contract rather than communal obligations and social status.  This also leads to a new legal system.
> In tightly knit kinship communities, one’s word guaranteed the trustworthiness of the exchange between neighbors.

Trading in anonymous markets requires enfocable legal code.
(**Executable legal contracts required for post-capitalist computer
mediated reputation economy??**)

While focus os on wool market and legally enforcable private-property this was also accompanied by tech change:  oxen->horse, 2-field to 3-field rotation, metallurgy, mechanical inventions (cam, spring, treadle, cranks, conecting rods, ...)  See Lynn White, Medieval Technology and Social Change (London: Oxford University Press, 1962), 129.  He claims importance to this proto-IR was printer+water/wind power. Marx states [Karl Marx, “Division of Labour and Mechanical Workshop: Tool and Machinery,” in Marx and Engels, Collected Works (New York: International Publishers, 1991), 33: 387–477](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1861/economic/ch35.htm):

> Gunpowder, the compass, and the printing press were the 3 great
inventions which ushered in bourgeois society. Gunpowder blew up the
knightly class, the compass discovered the world market and founded
the colonies, and the printing press was the instrument of
Protestantism and the regeneration of science in general; the most
powerful lever for creating the intellectual prerequisites.

Long discourse on water and wind power, in particular relation to
"fulling" (first step in turning wool into cloth). by 1790, .5million
water mills, thousands of wind mills.  water mill = 2 hp, wind
mill=30hp. Total water=2.25x10^6 hp.  This was more distributed than
ever before.  Leads to transfer of power from fuedal lords to
burghers.  Then along comes the printing press in 1436.  By 1503
8Million books printed.  More than all the books scribed in previous
1500 years.  Print makes maps accessible (for commerce), printed contracts (not oral), bookkeeping (bills of lading, invoices, checks, promissory notes.
> With print, commercial “trust” was sealed in written accounts accompanied by personal signatures.

The combination democratizes literacy & power. Challenges hierarchical
organization of fuedal life.  We get "free" towns.  Then, gathering of
craftsmen, then guilds.  By 17th century guilds bypassed. (guilds
quote "just" prices, not market prices. avoid free-labor markets)
Merchants bypass guilds and recruit cheaper labor "putting-out
system." On other side, small-manufacturing based on water/wind power
battle guilds with cheaper goods.  Merchants+manufacturers champion
domestic free trade, elimination of labor restrictions, legal
enforcement of commercial contracts, improvements in transportation.
Then 1776 & 1789:
> These two great defining moments in political history were as much
  about the struggle to secure private property through free trade in
  open markets as they were about securing political freedom and
  democratic representation.

# chapter 3 rifkin

Claim: rise of free market at end of medieval era was not capitalism
which arises in late 18th century with steam power.  Capitalism starts
in textile trade.

early putting-out system leased looms to rural labor. They barely get
by.  In late 16th century new manufacturers bring workers to factory
to harnes mills in production.  These manufacturers owned the tools.
Result: workers become "wage laborers" with new master - the
capitalist.  Concentration of ownership of the means of production
(capitalists subjugate labor) defines class struggle of late 18th
century.  Smith points out enclosure of land and enclosure ot tools
separates control over workers means of survival.  1st case: serfs
expelled from lands.  In 2nd case: workers separated from their tools.
Smith [Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth
of Nations (Edinburgh: Thomas Nelson, 1843), 22.]():

> the whole of what is annually either collected or produced by the labour of every society, or, what comes to the same thing, the whole price of it, is in this manner originally distributed among some of its different members. Wages, profit, and rent, are the three original sources of all revenue, as well as of all exchangeable value. All other revenue is ultimately derived from some one or other of these.

According to Rifkin: classical economists believe: "profits are the
just reward for capitalists who risk their capital."  Marx argues:
"the part of the worker’s contribution that is subtracted from his
wages and kept as profit— surplus value—is an unjust appropriation and
that a more equitable arrangement would be to socialize production and
let the workers enjoy the full benefit of their labor contribution."

Real capitalism comes with coal-powered
printing&locomotive/steam-engine.  1769 Watt patents steam engine
power by coal.  Between 1787-1840 british cotton production goes from
22x10^6 to 366x10^6 pounds whiles costs plummet.  Yet, in 1848 water
was 2.5x as much as steam power in france.by 1870 steam went from
4x10^6 hp to 18.5x10^6 hp. By 1830 locomotives going 60 mph. by 1850
21K miles of railroad tracks in US.  In 1847 NY->Chicago takes 3 weeks
by stagecoach.  In 1857 72 hours!  (and weather independent).  By 1859
1B$ invested in rail.  by 1870 60K miles of track. by 1900, 200K miles
(and this in spite of depression of 1870.)  All of this requireed new
business model - stock-holding company.  (**I thought the stock
holding company was invented by east india company and the like during
age of exploration in early 1500's**).  

This separates ownership from management and control.  So: workers
don't own tools and owners/investors don't control/manage businesses.
Huge capital investment led to vertical integration (RR companies
invests in steel, hotels, ...).  This vertical integration leads to
centralized, top-down command&control.  (**I think this is wrong way to view causation.  The lack of extra slack leads to tight control.  Emergent (read: distributed peer-to-peer control can't afford this.  With internet and such we can get to emergent properties of lateral control.  Also, without profit in mind some inefficiences can be traded off for robustness?**)

Steam-powered printers: 1814 thousands of copies/hour compared to 250 copies/hour of older manual printers.  By 1832 2x throughput.  America now gets public school system. By 1846 12K sheets per hour.  Startup cost of newspaper goes from (2005$) 100K to 2.38 Million.  leads to printing being centralized.  Combine with postal service going to rail. By 1900 catalogs for mass mail-order companies.  Ward's catalog lists 24k items.  in 1905 sears revenue is 75m$ (in 2005$).

1860's add in telegraph.  All increase speed and dependability for resources being marshaled, trasnported, processed, transformed into products, and distributed to customers.  All lead to centralized factories.

**what happened to electric motor, etc.?**

New rethink of economic model: before this production&distribution of manufactured goods are separate.  (require after sale support, etc.)  Claim: bring production and distribution into one vertically integrated business. becomes dominant model of 20th century.  (**doesn't ring true to me**)

success came from incorporating and raising capital to create these large vertically intergrated economics which scaled.

IR-2: at peak of IR-1 in 1880-1900, oil/internal combustion
engine/telephone create new energy/comm complex.  Oil requires even
more investment (and according to rifkin) more coordination than ever
before.  between 2000-11 $2.4 trillion invested in worldwide exploration/production.  Rockefeller, 1868 founded standard oil - buys oil wells, refineries, special rail arrangements, first to build gas stations.  By 1910 controls most of oil business in US.  By 1911 supreme court breaks it up.

1876 telephone. 1885 ATT formed.  Ultimate vertical company.  By 1900 (after patents expire in 1890s) have 3000 telephone company.  in 1921 senate commerce committee "telephoning is a natural monopoly."  Economists talk about it as a "public good"  In 1918 US nationalized!! telecomm under postmaster general. Vail (then president of ATT) gets great deal, raises rates, and demands similar deals with states.  Within 5.5 months of govt takeover 20% increase in long distance rates. after war goes back to private, but keeps rates. monopoly broken up in 1980s.

Telephone/oil-powered transport expands geographic range of economic
activity.  Allow tighter centralized control in real time.  In
meantime investment in electricity generation and distribution soars
and by 1910 10% of us homes have it.  by 1929 most homes are connected
to grid.  However, 1900 only 5% of factories use electricity.  Henry
ford changes that.  He writes:
> The provision of a whole new system of electric generation
  emancipated industry from the leather belt and line shaft, for it
  eventually became possible to provide each tool with its own
  electric motor. . . . The motor enabled machinery to be arranged
  according to the sequence of the work, and that alone has probably
  doubled the efficiency of industry. . . . Without high speed tools
  . . . there could be nothing of what we call modern industry.

3x productivity increase in first half of 20th century.  By 1916
3.4million cats in US.  1930 23million. leads to even more oil
production.  NBy 1930s oil is primary energy source in US.  WHile
roads are govt, cars are private.  Initially dozens of car companies.
But large investment needed for mass production quickly wittles it
down to a half dozen with the 3 leaders (Ford, GM, Chrysler).

Rail/steam-powered printing (and other) lead to urbanization around rail links, etc.  Automobile and road system change that - suburbanization with attendant spread of network infrastructure.

rifkin claims (p.47) IR-2 peaks and crashes in 2008 - crude oil $147. in 2008:

- three energy companies among 4 largest US companies.
- ATT & VErizon have 64% of telecomm
- 5% of electric companies control 40% of generation
- 4 auto companies (big 3 + toyoto) control 60% of auto market
- 5 media companies control 54% of US media.
- arcade/food/entertaiment 4 have 96% share. (**This seems wrong**)
- household applances: 4 companies control 90%.
- 10 banks control 60% of worldwide investment banking market

**Rifkin keeps harping on "vertically integrated corporate enterprises" but I am having a hard time swallowing that.  thoughts?**

# chapter 4:

theological ideas support the economic system.  Lu

- st. thomas for fuedalism: "Great Chain of Being"
- luther/calvin: each person stands before god. (increased literacy as people learn to read bible)
  > Rifkin: "The new emphasis on diligence, hard work, and frugality metamorphosed over the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries into the more economically laden term of being “more productive.” Self-worth became less about being of good character in the eyes of God and more about being productive in the new market exchange economy."
- locke (enlightement) for the market-exchange economiy defends private property (and against fuedalism). labor creates property, i.e., value. For example:
  > “has a property in his own person: [and] this no body has any right to but himself.”
- Smith according to rifkin:
  > final rebuff to the communal life exercised on the feudal commons, he declared that market behavior represents people’s true nature. 
- Tawney writes about this time:
  > Private property exchanged in the market economy was henceforth “taken for granted as the fundamentals upon which social organization was to be based, and about which no further argument was admissible.”

But, then capitalism threatens this as laborer only gets wages -
profit of item goes to owners (who aren't even involved in business).
> Richard Schlatter keenly observed that the classical school, beginning with the assumption that labour was the creator of property, was unable to construct an economic theory which was both consistent and did not lead to the conclusion that the man who profited without working was necessarily robbing the workman.

- socialists claim capitalism is outlier, praises lockeian view.
- capitalists abandon locke and pick on Hume and Benthan's theory of utilitarian value
  - Hume argues for public utility (from rikkin:)
    > [Hume argues] that private property rights should be encouraged not because they were based in natural rights but because they were “useful habits” and that property should be freely exchanged in the marketplace because it was “so beneficial to human society.” 
  - Bentham, even more extreme, no such thing as natural theory of property:
    > rights are, then, the fruits of the law, and of the law alone. There are no rights without law—no rights contrary to the law—no rights anterior to law . . . property and law are born and must die together.
  - Darwin was (mis-used and unhappily) used to support utilitarianism.
  - spencer advances social darwinism.  He viewed competition as social evolution and argued against govt interference.

rifkin's main point(s): 
> We shouldn’t confuse ownership of the means of production with the organization of the mode of production. Both capitalist and socialist regimes organize production in integrated, vertically scaled enterprises because of the increased efficiencies, despite their different patterns of ownership and distribution of earnings.

With IoT we need a new economic paradigm.  distributed not centralized.  optimize the general welfare with laterally integrated networks on the CC, not vertically integrated businesses in capitalist market.

music/publishing/media/entertainment already experiencing the laterally integrated economies of scale that push MC to 0.

# chapter 5

already have almost free information (**not true, we have free data
not information**).  Rifkin predicts free energy (e.g., solar which
uses sunlight and has MC=0).  So new comm/energy matrix:
internet/green-energy.

extreme productivity: MLCP=0.  internal contradition with capitalism
which drives to increase productivity, reduce prices to increase
demand.  But then what happens when it succeeds? goods and services
are free and system dies.

until recently economists measured productivity by 2 factors: machine
capital and labor performance.  Robert Solow looked at industrial age
and found these account for only 14% of all economic growth.  Where is
the other 86%?  Kummel and Ayres retrace growth and use 3
factors:machine capital, labor performance, and thermodynamic effiency
of energy use accounts for most of the 86%.  IOW, the **networks**
connecting us all (info and energy) are requireed to make the great
leaps forward. And, the networks are public infrastructure, i.e., a
public good.  from 1900-1980 energy efficiency rose from 2.48% to
12.3% to 13% in 1990s.  Rifkin claims we can get to 40% over next 40
years. **I would argue, if I were following Rifkin, which I don't
think I am, that with solar energy efficiency is not so important.  If
we got 1% of sunlight converted into energy and used that with 1%
efficiency we would have about 10x more power output than then used
today.**)

sensor actuator price drops:
- from 2012-2013 RFID drops 40% in price.
- MEMS (gyroscopes/accelerometers/pressure sensors drop 80% over five years.

privacy v. transparancy: privacy is recent.  Not until capitalist era did people retreat behind closed doors.  (**Muslim society??**).  With IoT (facebook, etc.) privacy is less appealing and inclusion into global virtual public sq gains appeal, i.e., transparancy.

**An Aside: I believe privacy will be replaced by transparancy,
  cryptographically authenticated fingerprints, and executable legal
  contracts.**

2013 Economist report [“The Internet of Things Business Index,” 11.](). survey:

- 38% of corporate leaders focast IoT “major impact in most markets and most industries” within 3 years.
- 40% say some impact.
- Already 75% of global companies are exploring or using IoT.
- 2/5 C-level respondens have > 1 formal meeting/month.

Thus, if you don't use IoT to increase thermodynamic efficiency and increase productivity you will be left behind.

** rifkin has a point and I think we should include something about energy in our technology picture.  Maybe Watt/$ for solar energy investment, or better yet, Watt/$-year to capture initial investment and marginal cost.  Track down "Scientific American published an article in 2011 asking whether Moore’s Law applies to solar energy,"**

Rifkin quoting Richard Swanson: Swanson's law. price of PV cells drops 20% for every 2x industrial capacity.  1976: $60/watt, 2013: $0.66/watt. [Sunshot Vision Study—February 2012,” U.S. Department of Energy, February 2012,](www1

additive v. subtractive manufacturing.  Democratization.  Download products. bits->atoms. etc.

Note: His picture of the state of the art for 3d printing is way off.  **do we need to be honest about current state of the art?  I.e., significant post-printing processing by humans, need for specialized single-sourced feedstock, IP in printer drivers, single material prints, resulting product must not require specific material properties, ...**

Etsy as example of IR-3's manufacturing, advertising, distribution, sales chain.

And, yet, rifkin gets it right:
> The new 3D printing revolution is an example of “extreme productivity.” It is not fully here yet, but as it kicks in, it will eventually and inevitably reduce marginal costs to near zero, eliminate profit, and make property exchange in markets unnecessary for many (though not all) products.

Gandhi coins term Swadeshi: The idea behind Swadeshi was to “bring work to the people and not people to the work.”[Hoda, Gandhi and the Contemporary World.](). Rifkin on Ghandi:
> His philosophy, on the other hand, emphasized decentralized economic production in self-sufficient local communities; the pursuit of craft labor over industrial-machine labor; and the envisioning of economic life as a moral and spiritual quest rather than a materialist pursuit. For Gandhi, the antidote to rampant economic exploitation and greed is a selfless commitment to community.

> His concept of happiness as the optimization of one’s relationships in shared communities rather than the autonomous pursuit of individual self-interest in the marketplace reflects the new dream of quality of life that is the hallmark of a Collaborative Age. 

# Chapter 7 (MOOCS)

Capitalist era prepares students as skilled industrial workers.  Conditioned to follow commands, learn by repetition, perform efficiently. Stock questions, exact answers.  Discuss "how" not "why"  Collaborative Age requires new pedagogy.  No more authoritarian, top-down instruction.  instead teachers are facilitators, lean to learn. inquiry over memorization.

> the notion of knowledge as an acquisition to be treated as a form of exclusive property made sense in a capitalist environment

> In Collaborative Age, learning is regarded as a crowdsourcing process and knowledge is treated as a publically shared good.

Lots of data on the different MOOCs, their reach, how they work.

Conundrum: If MC=0 to add the next student, then cost is 0.  Why are world class universities rushing to set up MOOCs? 1. idealism  2. if they don't they lose.  This points to shumpterian economics, where monopolies will get created and destroyed by better tech.  No?

# Chapter 8 (Last Worker Standing)

Comm/energy/manufacturing/education all going to MC->0.  So too with
labor because of big data, advanced analytics (read ML), algoritms,
AI, and robotics.

# Chapter 9 (prosumer and infrastructure for same)

> In a Collaborative Commons, sellers and buyers give way to
  prosumers, property rights make room for opensource sharing,
  ownership is less important than access, markets are superseded by
  networks, and the marginal cost of producing information, generating
  energy, manufacturing products, and teaching students is nearly
  zero. A central question arises: How is the new Internet of Things
  infrastructure that makes all of this possible going to be financed?

question of financing infrastructure called the “marginal-cost controversy”.
In December 1937, Harold Hotelling, in  “The General Welfare in Relation to Problems of Taxation and of Railway and Utility Rates”  He begins with “the optimum of the general welfare corresponds to the sale of everything at marginal cost.” To recoup investment every entrepreneur builds in the upfront costs in the sale of each unit. However, public goods (i.e., that are nonrivalrous because everyone needs to have access to them) E.g., rooads, bridges, sewage systems, electricity grids, etc. require significant capital expenditure.  Because they are nonrivalrous they favor natural monopoly.  How should they be paid for?  Hotelling argued that govt should finance through taxes.  He uses Bridge as an example:
> A free bridge costs no more to construct than a toll bridge, and costs less to operate; but society, which must pay the cost in some way or other, gets far more benefit from the bridge if it is free, since in this case it will be more used. Charging a toll, however small, causes some people to waste time and money in going around by longer but cheaper ways, and prevents others from crossing.[Harold Hotelling, “The General Welfare in Relation to Problems of Taxation and of Railway and Utility Rates,” Econometrica 6(3)
(July, 1938):258]

he concluded that general government revenue should 
> “be applied to cover the fixed costs of electric power plants, waterworks, railroads, and other industries in which the fixed costs are large, so as to reduce to the level of marginal cost the prices charged for the services and products of these industries.”

Many agreed with him, but some argued that since these goods are
nonrivalrous charging for "declining average cost" would be more
sensible.  **I have asked myself this same question.  Mark?**

1946, Ronald Coase, agrees that price should equal MC, but total cost needs to be covered.  He suggests: 
> a multipart pricing scheme in which those using the public good paid an additional fee on top of the marginal cost price for carriage charges. That way, those using the service would pay a little extra for carriage rather than taxpayers, some of whom wouldn’t even use the service. Multipart pricing, Coase believed, would allow both the marginal cost and total cost to be covered.

** Mark, can you explain this to me? **

Coarse wins the day.  Important now since we are building out infrastructure for IoT.

Who owns the internet?  **His argument is sort of slanted and a bit wrong**

argument about feed-in tariffs and original centralized rip-off by energy companies, but increasing prosumer small guys.  This is a tipping point away from a few companies controlling all the energy generation and distributon. **IS it really?**

To build a smart energy network rifkin estimate would cost 1.2T$ over 30 years.  (Which is just 5 years of royal dutch shell revenue!)  EPRI stidy shows energy savings alone would be $2T.

talks about cleanweb movement (see sunil Paul& Nick Allen).  See "New York Clean Web Hackathon"

Zuckerber's law: info shared on web 2x every year.

Pages 119-121. New tech can convert a scarce resouce (e.g., spectrum) into an abundant one.

However, how do we find a governance model that can handle this?

P 122-x: uses selling of spectrum by fcc as an example of new governance model which is championed by Eli Noam, Tochai Benkler, and Kevin Werbach who don't want it sold (as big telecomms will just hog it) or have the govt manage it (ineficient), but rather create a new governing model call the *Networked Commons*.  **He doesn't explain exactly what it is. mark?**

# Chapter 10: Comedy of the commons

Garrett Hardin’s essay “The Tragedy of the Commons,” Science, 1968.
**ELC and webcams solve this tragedy** See [Garrett Hardin, “The
Tragedy of the Commons,” Science 162(3859) (December 13, 1968)]() In
Hardin's essay he leaves out the governence model of commons.  That is
the reason is did work for so long in medival times.  **And, we can
re-introduce this even in a global distributed society with ELC,
survellience cameras, and ML** (also note the important part of the
quote: "Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that
compels him to increase his herd without limit—in a world that is
limited.")

In re-examining commons as a governence model it may be a good model for 
> a transitioning economy where centralized command and control of
  commerce is capitulating to distributed, laterally scaled,
  peer-to-peer production, where property exchange in markets is
  becoming less relevant than access to sharable goods and services in
  networks, and where social capital is becoming more valued than
  market capital in orchestrating economic life.

See [Carol Rose, “The Comedy of the Commons,” University of Chicago
Law Review 53(3) (1986): 720.]() for one example of this re-examing.
Not everything can be owned, e.g., oceans, rivers, air, roads, ... --
public goods.  She distinguishes property as: private, govt controlled
public, and "inherently public" This last is > collectively “owned”
and “managed” by society at large, with claims independent of and
indeed superior to the claims of any purported governmental
manager. [Carol Rose, “The Comedy of the Commons,” University of
Chicago Law Review 53(3) (1986): 720.]()

Legally this is known as "customs claims"  i.e., rights that have existed beyond memory.  **This is all important and I am too tired to get it right.**

Rifkin:
> The right to be included, to have access to one another, which is
  the right to participate “in common,” is the fundamental property
  right, while private property, the right to enclose, own, and
  exclude is merely a qualified deviation from the norm—although in
  modern times the qualification has all but subsumed the norm.

link between ancient property right to the commons is similar to net
nuetrality. 

> Rose saw that the “publicness” of goods and services “created the
  ‘rent’ of the property, and public-property doctrines—like
  police-power doctrines—protected that publicly created rent from
  capture through private holdout.” [Rose, P. 774]()

Elinor Ostrom’s "The Governing of the Commons" first comprehensive
economic and anthropological analysis on the history of the commons
(wins her the nobel prize in economics?) "the commons has proven
itself to be a formidable governing institution and worthy of
reconsideration in light of the environmental, economic, and social
challenges and opportunities facing humanity in an increasingly
connected global world."[Elinor Ostrom, Governing the Commons,
(Cambridge University Press, 1990), 58.]() "the glue that kept the
commons viable was the agreed-upon self-management protocols entered
into voluntarily by the democratic participation of all the members."

Look into history of "The Törbel Commons covenant agreement of 1483"

Rikfin:
> If there is an essential theme to the commons, it is that the people who know best how to govern their lives are the members of the community themselves.

ostrom's seven principles:  
1. clear boundaries on who can take what from the commons
2. appropriation rules restricting time, place, tech, labor, material, money quantuty of resources that can be taken or allotted to the appropriation.
3.  commons association must ensure those affected by the rules determine them
4. monitoring is done by members or are accountable to them.
5. penalties must be graduated and appropriate to avoid ill will
6. procesures for low-cost mediation for quick resolution
7. govt must recognize rules of common association

Flies against adam smith - each individual is NOT seeking to optimize
for themselves.  E.g., Rifkin:
> Cognitive scientists tell us that our neural circuitry is soft wired for experiencing empathic distress and that evolutionary survival has depended far more on our collective sociability than our self-directed proclivities.

He suggests that Reagan/Thatcher move to privatize puiblic goods
hollowed out government and is final surrender of public
responsibility for overseeing general welfare of society.  People
sought for another governing model - one neither centeralized and nor
private. This leads to rediscovering the commons.  He suggests this is
also an anti-enclosure movement.  Where the enclosure this time (not
fences around property) is around IP, e.g., patents, esp those of genes.

He links open-software movement and cheap synthetic bio techniques to commons.

# 2/8 chapter 11

1st IR: severed workers from their tools and investors from management
of their companies.
3rd IR: consumers becoming producers whom collaborate.

Clash looming between collaborationists and capitalists. A cultural
conflict - democtratizaiton of everything. "The Free Culture movement"
Stallman (free software is free speech) V. Gates. (free software is theft).

GNU and the GPL. GPL enshrines four freedoms (below) and the software commons  
1. use software for whatever
2. study the software
3. modify the software
4. redistribute it with your changes

GNU -> GPL -> free culture movement -> linux + internet -> greatest
collaboration in human history?

GPL too scary for business and Eric Raymond creates opensource (v. free) software.

Rifkin:
> There was a growing awareness of the Internet as a place where human
  beings create social capital rather than market capital.

print democratized writing. This leads to copyright, e.g., "owning"
ones thoughts and words.  -> ideas and thoughts are product of one's labor and can be sold.  An enclosure of communications.  print privatizes communication, i.e., no real-time dialogue.  Contrast with internet, Rifkin:
> The interconnectivity and interactivity of the medium cries out for
  collaboration and gives rise to what Lessig calls the “remix”
  culture, in which everyone is playing off everyone else, using a mix
  of media and adding their own variations to a theme, and passing it
  down the line in a never-ending game.

So now we get: GNU -> GPL -> Creative Commons.

The below makes no sense to me:
> Patents and copyrights thrive in an economy organized around
  scarcity but are useless in an economy organized around
  abundance. Of what relevance is intellectual-property protection in
  a world of near zero marginal cost, where more and more goods and
  services are nearly free?

Read: In 2003, James Boyle, a professor of law at Duke University and
a founder of Creative Commons, published an essay entitled “The Second
Enclosure Movemen and the Construction of the Public Domain.”

Boyle & the environmental movement with parallels to free culture movement.  Transborder parks as an anti-enclosure movement. 
> The very idea that nature’s boundaries supersede political and commercial boundaries in importance has the effect of redirecting the social narrative away from individual self-interests, commercial pursuits, and geopolitical considerations to the general wellbeing of nature.

The Gaia hypothesis leads Boyle to 
> what they call cultural environmentalism—a systems theory of the indivisibility of the public domain that might unite all the disparate interests and initiatives in an overarching general theory.

Rifkin equates the optimality of ecosystem of the amazon with the optimal economy - MC=0:
> That is the point at which the production and distribution of each additional unit and the recycling of waste requires the least expenditure of energy in the form of time, labor, capital, and power generation, optimizing the availability of resources.

Long riff on the WTO, the arab spring, occupy wall street, etc. as
reclaiming the commons.

> The Commons, old and new, define the way human beings manage Earth’s
  bounty. To say something is a Commons is to mean that it is held in
  common and collectively managed. The term Commons describes a form
  of governance. Hess reminds us that something can’t become a Commons
  until the technological means are available to manage
  it. Forager/hunters enjoyed the bounty of nature, but did not manage
  it. The Commons begins with agriculture and pastoralism. The oceans
  didn’t become a Commons until the invention of vessels to travel on
  them.

3rd IR brings new form of production:
> “Commons-based peer-production,” to distinguish it from the property-and contract-based modes of firms and markets. Its central characteristic is that groups of individuals successfully collaborate on large-scale projects following a diverse cluster of motivational drives and social signals, rather than either market prices or managerial commands.[Yochai Benkler, “Coase’s Penguin, or, Linux and The Nature of the Firm,” Yale Law Journal 112(369) v.04.3 (August 2002): 1–2](http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.PDF)

# chapter 12 (infrastructure)

communication infrastructure/the communication commons

economic revolutions re really infrastructure revolutions and this is
powerful when the communication infrastructure and energy
infrastructure are synergistic.  E.g., Steam with steam-power printing/telegraph or Oil/Electricity without telephone/radio/tv

If internet continues with fossil fuel, then the distribtued nature of
internet will not be realized because fossil fuel economy demands
highly capitalized, centralized, vertical integrated business -> centralized
management, economics of scale, ...

Rifkin suggests internet (peer-to-peer, collaborative, laterally
scaled communications) works best with renewable energy (which are
also distributed, ...) and best served by "commons management" ->
internet of things (energy, communication, logistics)

Internet goverened as a commons by ICANN, IEFT, WWWC, and the IGF
(Internet Governance Forum) which represents govt, private enterprise,
and civil society.  Long argument about net nuetraility and govt and
private enterprise taking over and why this is a struggle between old
IR paradigm and new one.  I.e., enclosure of the internet v. a commons.

long riff on big internet companies enclosing their data.  are these
companies "natural monopolies"?

Rifkin:
> In other words, the problem is that companies are operating a social Commons as a commercial venture. Zeynep Tufekci, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina, calls this practice “the corporatization of the social Commons.”

**Idea: start a social media company which is public.  Each registered
  user gets a share of the company.  They get a fraction of a share
  when they get a friend to register.  All comments are linkable.  All
  data is owned by the company (i.e., the users).  Could this company
  crack facebook's hold?**

now riff on energy internet commons V. big oil.  new commons model
based on 1930s model to bring electrcity to rural america - the TVA.
This is Hotelling (build it as a public good paid by taxes) V. Coase
(free-market).  Story of REA (Rural Electric Administration) and
electical cooperatives to help get power lines to all of rural
america.  The electical cooperatives were run under a commons model.
Very successful and
> Every argument that Hotelling advanced in his paper in favor of
  federal government financing of the TVA proved to be astonishingly
  accurate.

Rifkin concludes that Hotelling (govt management) and Coase
(capitalist market) approaches to optimizing general welfare were both
wrong and actual unfolding was 3rd approach: the cooperative
(supported by govt through subsidies, etc.) was what happened and was
very efficient.  The result:
> Today, 900 nonprofit rural electric cooperatives serve 42 million
  customers over 2.5 million miles in 47 states. ... 42 percent of the
  nation’s electricity distribution lines ... cover[ing} 75 percent of
  the nation’s landmass and deliver 11 percent of the total kilowatts
  sold in the United States. The combined assets of rural electric
  cooperatives total more than $140 billion. ... provid[ing] “at cost”
  electric service to their customers.

Cooperatives are designed to operate as a commons.  Different goals
than companies.  Defined by ICA as:
> an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically controlled enterprise.[“Cooperative Principles and Values,” International Cooperative Alliance, 2011](http://www.cdi.coop/icaprinciples.html)

Modern Cooperative began in england in 1844 - 28 textile workers
formed "Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers"  7 rules from them now part of ICA:

1. any individual can be member.  No bias against race, religion, ...
2. democracy, 1 member 1 vote.  Elected reps come from members and responsible for managment.
3. capital comes from members.  Jointly decide on how funds are used.
4. cooperative is autonomous.
5. cooperative provides ongoing education and training to members.
6. expected to broaden networked commons by expanding and integrating across world
7. sustainable development in their communities.

Claim: 
- today >10^9 people are members of cooperatives.
- Cooperatives are the only business model that will work in a near zero marginal cost society.

long story on green electricity cooperatives.

Then, Logistics commons. IoT.  Roads/rails are public goods, but the
transport is public and private.  Private controlled logistics is
inefficient: Empty trucks, 1.6T in inventory in US, underutilized
warehouses, spoilage (time-sensitive losses), inefficent routes
(because of location of centeralized warehouses).  In 2009 10% of US
GDP was transportation.  IoT will change logistics. (his mantra:
distributed, collaborative, laterally scaled, open-systems
architecture, commons-style management).  Irony not lost on rifkin:
original internet thinking modeled on interstate highway, etc. Now
going otherway.  Packet of info <-> modular container with smart tags
and need for protocols.

> Unlike most traditional Commons, where the primary self-policing
  concern is stewarding common physical resources to prevent a
  depletion of stock, the three infrastructure Commons of the
  collaborative era need to steward temporal resources to prevent
  congestion.

# chapter 13 (from ownership to access)

private property is defining characteristic of capitalism.
"Automobile is signature item" -> economic idea that human nature is
driven by need for Auto(nomy) and mobil(ity).  "The automobile
represents the ultimate enclosure."  "In the capitalist era, we came
to define freedom in *negative* terms as the right to exclude. The
automobile became the symbol of our conventional notion of freedom."  

"The Internet generation ...think[s] of freedom in ... the positive
sense of the right to be included with others. ... Freedom is measured
more by access to others in networks than ownership of property in
markets."  Then moves to using car as metaphore, i.e., rise in *car
sharing* is preference for access to ownership.  

> A study of leading carsharing enterprises found that 80 percent of
  the members sampled who owned a car before car sharing sold it after
  joining the network. [Anita Hamilton, “Will Car-Sharing Networks
  Change the Way We Travel?,” Time, February 7,
  2012](http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2094921_2094923_2106141,00.html)

One thing leads to another.  Car sharers drive less, reduce co2
emissions.  Bike sharing rising.  And, both car sharing and bike
sharing likely to be run by nonprofits.  in US average vehicle is idle
92% of time! [Adam Cohen, Susan Shaheen, and Ryan McKenzie,
“Carsharing: A Guide for Local Planners,” PAS Memo
(2008)](http://pubs.its.ucdavis.edu/download_pdf.php?id=1240).  Also
car sharing is leading way to electric vehicles.  Also, peer-to-peer
carsharing, e.g., RelayRides.  "Car-share clubs are increasingly using
Integrated Transportation Provider Services (ITPS) to help their
members switch from one mode of transport to another en route. "

> for a citizen of a city like Ann Arbor [Michigan], such a service
  [car sharing] could be more than 70% cheaper and would require
  residents to invest less than one-fifth of the amount needed to own
  their cars.[Lawrence Burns, “A Vision of Our Transport Future,” Nature 497 (May 9, 2013): 181–82]()

Driverless car case:
- "90 percent of automobile accidents are caused by human error."[Alex Hudson, “Will Driverless Cars Mean Computer Crashes?,” BBC News, October 1, 2012](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/9755210.stm)
- "In the Collaborative Age, when time is the scarce commodity and attention is at a premium, freeing oneself from driving an automobile several hours a day is significant extra time to attend to more interesting activities in virtual space."

**driverless car and car sharing are symbiotic, since the car can come to you!**

> the very thought of leaving markets and the exchange of property
  behind—of advancing a conceptual change in the structuring of human
  relationships away from ownership and toward access—is as
  inconceivable to many people today as enclosure and privatization of
  land and labor into property relationships must have been more than
  a half a millennium ago. [However,] it is likely that for a growing
  number of enterprises and consumers, the very idea of ownership will
  seem limited, even old fashioned, 25 years from now.[Jeremy Rifkin,
  The Age of Access]()

- ownership -> access
- markets -> networked commons

Claim:
> The way out [of the 2008 great recession] was to turn the entire
  economic system on its head—buy less, save more, and share what one
  has with others. Runaway consumption would be replaced by a
  shareable economy.

> The sharing economy was born. This is a different kind of
  economy—one far more dependent on social capital than market
  capital. And it’s an economy that lives more on social trust rather
  than on anonymous market forces.

Airbnb growing 500% per year.  In 2014 (projected) to fill more rooms
per night than hilton and intercontinental hotel chains.  Compare to
couchsurfing, a non-profit "viewing its mission more broadly as social
rather than commercial in nature."

> Sharing represents the best part of human nature. Reducing addictive consumption, optimizing frugality, and fostering a more sustainable way of life is not only laudable, but essential if we are to ensure our survival.

Yerdle (matches facebook friends with stuff to trade, buy, sell, ...)

> **Shareable** magazine, a nonprofit online media publication that
  reports on new developments in the collaborative consumption
  economy, notes that while U.S. retail sales in 2011 were $4.7
  trillion, collaborative consumption represented nearly $100
  billion in turnover that year.

SharedEarth: sharing backyard gardens.  CSA (consumer supported ag)
started in 60s.  Consumers pledge $ before growing season, i.e.,
almost like shareholders.  They get delivered whatever is grown, so
all share in bounty and drought alike.  Internet maks connections easier.

health care story is a bit of a reach.  Analogy made to wikipedia.

End of advertising?  as people opt out of consuming and start sharing.
Furthermore, people rely on reviews. E.g., “72% of consumers said they
trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations.” 87% says
good review seals deal to buy. 65% trust word of mouth more than
advertisers.

Past: people put up with ads to get content.  Present: users make
their own content (flickr, facebook, ...) Why should they tolerate
ads?  "social economy governed by interactive peer-to-peer
engagement."  Clemons believes that paid advertising “will fail as a
major revenue source for most Internet sites”[Eric Clemons, “Why
Advertising Is Failing on the Internet,” Tech Crunch, March 22, 2009]
(http://techcrunch.com/2009/03/22/why-advertising-is-failing-on-the-internet/).

More doom and gloom for internet advertising.  Sites stuff about
google revenues going down, transition to mobile will further decrease
revenue.

Summary:   
- "If we think of a collaborative economy as both gift giving
as well as redistribution and recycling with or without compensation,
everyone is covered." 
- "favoring access over ownership."

lending clubs. crowdfunding.  (**Is it worth getting the trend line on this in terms of dollars raised?**)

**I never quite got the crowdfunding bug, my capital, my risk - where is my reward?  If reputation had a metric, then I could imagine my reward would come from that.  Could a place like kickstarter create a reputation metric that "investors" got which would somehow help them when they started a kickstarter campaign?**

Social trust is necessary glue.  reputation systems to rank trust is
in most systems.  conventional credit-rating -> market economy,
reputation -> ranks social capital in commons.  **If this is true,
then reputation is a secondary metric, not tradeable**

E.g, ThredUP: only send what you would want to receive. Ranks quality,
style, punctuality" sending in frayed/torn items 2 times gets you
removed.

**If you believe this story on currency, really need to ask what makes a currency work.  trust, some underlying convertion to value?**

rifkin claims cooperatives best to be symbiotic between capitalist econ of the market and social econ of the commons.  "benefit coporation"[“What are B Corps?—Legislation,” B Corporation, April 18, 2013](http://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/legislation) in US. E.g., patagonia.  Still profit making, but can have social mandates as well.  A new vehicle for social entrepreneurs. Another is the L3C - allow low profit.

"social enterprises" make up 3.5% of 2012 US GDP. 35% non-for-profits, 31% Corp or LLC.  60% created after 2006. 29% created in 2011&2012. **what is trend line?**

Finally says it: "the smart IoT ... is going to carry on much of the
economic activity of civilization with a small supervisory and
professional work force."  His take: converting to IoT will create
employement surges over next 40 years. "While fewer human beings will
be required to produce goods and services in the market economy,
machine surrogates will play a smaller role on the Commons for the
evident reason that deep social engagement and the amassing of social
capital is an inherently human enterprise." **Huh?** "The nonprofit
sphere is already the fastest-growing employment sector in many of the
advanced industrial economies" **get trends [Lester Salamon, “Putting

>IT’S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT IN A SOCIETY where the market imperative and
 capitalist mystique are so firmly entrenched in popular lore, not to
 mention in government subsidies, that the slew of new economic
 initiatives and institutional arrangements flooding onto the
 Collaborative Commons are still being treated as mere supplements to
 the main economic currents. Few are suggesting that the quickening
 pace to near zero marginal cost that is beginning to impact the
 media, entertainment, and publishing industries; renewable energies;
 3D printing of manufacturedproducts; and opensource online higher
 education are any more than variations that can be fit comfortably
 within the existing economic paradigm. Even fewer are suggesting that
 the replacement of the global workforce with AI and automated
 technology, the shift from ownership to access, the transformation
 from markets to networks, and the emergence of a sharing economy
 represents a fundamental assault on the system itself. Even when
 confronted with the crowdfunding of capital, the democratization of
 currency, and the rapid spread of social entrepreneurialism, there is
 little worry that they pose any kind of significant threat to
 capitalism. Yet one can’t help but be awed by how these new models
 fundamentally diverge from the standard way we have organized
 economic life over the past two centuries.

# Chapter 15 (Abundance)

MC=0 -> capitalism loses its rationale since it is based on scarcity.
"_Free_ implies free in two senses of the term: free in price and free
from scarcity. ... Exchange value becomes useless because everyone can
secure much of what they need without having to pay for it."

ecological footprint: "measures the amount of biologically productive
land and water that is required to produce all the resources an
individual or population consumes and to absorb the waste they
generate, given prevailing technology and resource-management
practices."  In 1961: eco footprint = 1/2 planet's biocapacity.  2008:
18/12 of biocapacity.

World Watch Institute: tracks the human impact on global resources

Another metric: happiness. "When individuals reach an income level
that provides the basic comforts and securities of life, their level
of happiness begins to plateau." Then diminishing returns, then actual
decreases in happiness.

"Happiness studies show that countries that have the smallest gap
between rich and poor score higher in their sense of collective
happiness and wellbeing."

On materialism: > Our Enlightenment philosophers, at the very
beginning of the modern era, painted a picture of human nature as
rational, self-interested, materialistic, utilitarian, and driven by a
need for autonomy—all of which predisposes us to accumulate more
property and become an island unto ourselves. The new scientific
studies tell a different story. Human beings are the most social of
creatures. We yearn for companionship and crave social
embeddedness. Much of that sociability is soft wired into our neural
circuitry and either nourished or extinguished by our culturalization.

mirror nuerons <-> hardwire us for empathy.

hegel argues "beyond its utilitarian and material value, property is
an expression of one’s persona. ... Our property becomes
indistinguishable from our personality."  Advertising feeds on
this. Riff on millenials and whether they have more or less empathy
than in the past.  Post great recession: "Millenials ... has begun to
shift its psychic priorities from material success to living a
meaningful existence."

His summary:

1. money doesn’t buy happiness. 
2. rampant materialism, far from making people happier, makes them increasingly alienated, fearful, mistrusting, and lonely.
3. primary human drive is not insatiable material wants, but the quest for sociability. 

Commons ok, because "It’s scarcity that breeds overconsumption, not
abundance. In a world where everyone’s material needs are met, the
fear of going without is extinguished."

riff on Pop growth and electricity, i.e., "the key to population
stabilization on Earth is access to electricity."

for rifkin two caveats to sucess: global warming & cyberterrorism.
Long riff on these.  One thing of interest: distributed smart grid
likely to be more resiliant.  Talks about risk to electic grid and
transformers in particular.

# chapter 16 (biosphere lifestyle)

1IR and 2IR: 30 years of infrastructure invesment and 20 years to
maturity.  3IR is happening even more quickly.  **He doesn't make the
leap that 1 and 2 were linear events and 3IR is an exponential
event.** THough he cites for example, WWW from creation in 1990 to
maturity in 2013.

hunter/gather society: energy is human body.  Comm is oral language.
Empathy is to family and tribe.  studies show largest cohesive
community is ~500 people.[Robin Dunbar, Grooming, Gossip, and the
Evolution of Language (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998),
70.]()

"Great hydailic civilizations in middle east ~3500BC, Yangtzze
~3950BC, Indus Vallye ~2500BC: infrastructure canel-irrigated
ag. energy regime: stored grain. comm: writing.  We get religion
(judochristian, confucious, and buddhism resp.), central government.
Shift from mythological to theological conscieousness.  Empathy based
on religous identity.  E.g., the golden rule, “do unto others as you
would have others do unto you.” "social bonds across the more
expansive temporal and spatial reach of the new civilizations"

19th century: coal-powered steam printing/factory/rail creates “ideological consciousness.”  We get nation-state. citizens are extended family. "empathic sensibility [extends] beyond blood and religious ties to include national ties."

20th century: centralized electricity, oil, automobile, mass consumer
moves from ideological to “psychological consciousness.”
> Psychological consciousness extended the empathic drive across
  political boundaries to include associational ties. Human beings
  began to empathize in a larger fictional family based on
  professional and technical affiliations, cultural preferences, and a
  range of other attributes that stretched the boundaries of social
  trust beyond the nation to include affinity with like-minded others
  in a world where the communication/energy matrix and markets were
  becoming global.

> Mythological consciousness, theological consciousness, ideological
  consciousness, and psychological consciousness all still exist and
  coexist in ensembles embedded in each individual psyche and in
  various proportions and degrees in every culture.

riff on empathy:

> Often, people mistake empathic consciousness with utopianism when,
  in fact, it is the very opposite. ... [empathy] tinged with the
  whiff of their eventual death and the celebration of their existing
  life. ... that life is fragile and imperfect and challenging,
  ... feel the frailty and the transitory nature of another’s
  existence.

3IR will be cross over to "biosphere consciousness" extension of
empathy to whole human race.

afterward has interesting take on adam smith's invisible hand.  What I
would call rationale capitalism, e.g., "it’s in an entrepreneur’s
self-interest to be sensitive to the wellbeing of others if he wants
to succeed."  At the very least his buyers.

Can we look back at previous economic systems and see how their very
sucess lead to their being replaced?  Capitalism's goal of increasing
productivity leads to MC=0, which destroys it.  Can same be said of
previous systems? **investigate**


# 1/27 notes from The zero marginal cost society (chapter 1)

This is all from [The zero marginal cost society](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~seth/fow/bib/rifkin14.html)

Say's law and classical economics: new technology increases productivity which lowers prices in turn increasing demand which in turn forces competitors to search for new tech to lower prices, etc.  All this works great except when the market is NOT competitive, i.e., monopoly.  

Taken to the extreme, we get infinite productivity and zero marginal cost of production.  Then, profit becomes zero.  (**This seems to be a bedrock of economic theory.  is it a must?  Can we get around this?**)

Get footnote 2 for bib. (3d printer projections)

follow up on Keynes, Robert Heilbroner, and Wassily Leontief: they
examine the MCP=0 extreme of succesful capitalism.

Oskar Lange, 1936, (note 4) examines extreme productivity

Read: Keynes, "Economic Possibilitie for our Grandchildren"

What is Keynes refering to when he talks about mankind's "economic problem"?

See Keynes, Essays in Presuasion, pages 358-74 (on gutenberg).  He talks about machines doing our labor and people being able to pursue art!

From Freaks, Geeks, and GDP, by Anne Lowrey 2011. Explaining why computing has not led to huge increases in gdp or productivity per capita (Is this part of the MCP=0 argument?)
> That is in part because the Internet and computers tend to push costs
toward zero, and have the capacity to reduce the need for labor. You
are, of course, currently reading this article for free on a Web site
supported not by subscriptions, but by advertising. You probably read
a lot of news articles online, every day, and you probably pay nothing
for them. Because of the decline in subscriptions, increased
competition for advertising dollars, and other Web-driven dynamics,
journalism profits and employment have dwindled in the past
decade. (That Cowen writes a freely distributed blog and published his
ideas in a $4 e-book rather than a $25 glossy airport hardcover should
not go unnoted here.) Moreover, the Web- and computer-dependent
technology sector itself does not employ that many people. And it does
not look set to add workers: The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates
that employment in information technology, for instance, will be lower
in 2018 than it was in 1998.

If the most efficient economy is where consumers only pay for the marginal cost of a good, then if we assume continuing advances in technology and productivity, then monopolies are a natural outcome, no?

I think I am starting to undersstand shumpterian economics: an
efficient economy that comes about by having monopolies replace each
other through creative destruction.  This is one possible outcome to
MCP=0.  **The question is then, how do the new companies get the capital to compete with the existing monopolies?**

Comment on rifkin's argument about thermodynamics: It is bogus.  While
there is no change in the amount of energy in a closed system, the
earth isn't closed.  We get almost 5x10^6 watt-hours/(meter^2)/year
(assuming 12 hours of sun per day).  If we only count less than half
the earth's surface, then thats more than 10^19 watt-hours/year.  **above is wrong, it is 470 exajoules of energy to Earth every 88 minutes.  Need to do the math right**

Is Rifkin's story about collaborative commons arising from fuedalism
correct?  His connection to post-fuedal collabortive commons (.e.g,
workers creating self-governing commons e.g., schools, etc.) is
clearly bogus. **Those were not created by workers as far as I know.
Am i right?**

He equates "civil society" and "nonprofit sector" and is saying it is
morphing into "social commons"

He claims capitalist market promotes property rights, caveat emptor,
and the search for autonomy.  Social commons prompts open-source
innovation, transparency, and search for community.  Not sure I buy this.  However, his statement that we are creating a tech platform to support social commons is correct.

**Old IR was synergistic with hierarchical networks.  New Tech is synergistic with peer-to-peer networks.**

From Rifkin: prosumers producing and sharing - entertainment, MOOCs,
... all at MC almost 0.  Sharing homes, cars, ... similarly.
crowdfunding. alternative social currencies. Resuling in "exchange
value" is being replaced by "sharable value".  **Can this explain lack
of percieved producitivity increase?** Rifkin: "As the marginal cost
of producing good and services moves towards near zero in sector after
sector, profits are narrowing and GDP is beinning to wane."  as good
and services become free -> less GDP. People pay for access instead of
ownership (e.g., sharing cars, tools, etc.) -> less GDP.  as
capitalist system wanes and collaborative commons increases "economic
welfare is measurede less by the accumulation of market capital and
more by the aggregation of social capital" (**His use of social
capital is non-standard, right?**)

With this new parigigm we need new ways to measure economic performance.  GDP is a measure of total good and services produced each year.  Some institutions (EU, UN, OECD) are looking at new metrics that measure "quality of life"

Quandary of capitalism is if everything is free who will innovate
(since no profit to recoup cost of initial investment).  But, it is happening on collaborative commons.

claim: "great economic transformations occurred when human beings
discovered new energy regimes and created new communication media to
organize them."  IR-1: steam-power, printing&telegraph.  Coal-powered
rail and factory.  IR-2: telephone, radio&tv - oil, auto.  Now:
internet & renewable energy.  Thus, "The technology platforms of the
First and Second Industrial Revolutions were designed to be
centralized with top-down command and control."  fossil fuels only
found in certain places, needed centralized management to distribut to
end-users.  huge $ cost to get these hierarchical
communication/distriubution going.  (**I think is story is right, but
needs refinement**)

He then claims that CC breaks monopoly with peer-to-peer network.  Big
leap here even though I believe the outcome.  The argument is not
here. Another unsubstantiated claim: 
> "these distributed renewable
energies have to be organized collaboratively and shared peer-to-peer
across communities and regions to create sufficient lateral economies
of scale to bring their marginal cost to zero for everyone in
society."  

His Claim: IoT infrastructure for communication, energy, and logistics will: 
> By eliminating virtually all of the remaining middlemen who mark up
the transaction costs at every stage of the value chain, small- and
medium-sized enterprises—especially cooperatives and other nonprofit
businesses—and billions of prosumers can share their goods and
services directly with one another on the Collaborative Commons—at
near zero marginal cost. The reduction in both fixed and marginal
costs dramatically reduces the entry costs of creating new businesses
in distributed peer-to-peer networks.

He doesn't actually try and back up any of the above.  **Definitely doesn't address the network effect** when he says:
>The low entry costs encourage more people to
become potential entrepreneurs and collaborators, creating and sharing information, energy, and
goods and services on the Commons.

He distinguishes two big changes:  Fuedal -> market economy, market -> capitalist economy.  **What is the market economy?**

IR-1 and IR-2 are centralized and top-down due to size of and management of the investment needed move energy and goods.

# 1/21 Meeting with Mark and review of ["new economy" paper](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~seth/fow/bib/ds01.html)

## Questions and (some) answers

- P.32: "Our third conclusion" paragraph still don't understand

- P.32: price discrimination - ability to charge different prices in different
  markets.  Usually applied to monopolies.  In this paper they suggest
  that for new economy this might be a good thing.

- P.33: "Smithian" economy: 
  - Where goods are "rival" or "excludable"
  - Where price should equal marginal social cost
  - "marginal social cost" is marginal cost with externalities included in cost
  - where decentralized market economy gets best outcome

- P.33: "Schumpeterian" economy:
  - What the new economy is likely to look like
  - where increasing returns to scale is a reality
  - implies natural monopolies will rule
  - implies competitive equilibrium won't produce best outcome
  - implies competition is not on goods, but creative destruction

- P.37: Don't understand entire section dealing with p=s(pL)+(1-s)(pR)

- P.37 income elasticity: For "normal" goods, as income goes up, demand curve shifts to right
  for "?" goods, e.g., spam, as income goes up, demand curve shifts to left

- P.38: They suggest that productivity will resume after dot come bust, but it didn't.  Why not?

- P.42: "intensive margin"? 
- P.42: "extensive margin"? 

- P.43: "supply-side economies of scale"  I.e., marginal (and average) cost goes down with increased output
- P.43: "demand-side economies of scope" ?

- P.43: "Thus, in the “new economy,” more markets will be contestable.
  Competitive edges based on past reputations, or brand loyalty, or adver-
  tising footprints will fade away. As they do so, profit margins will fall:
  Competition will become swifter, stronger, more pervasive, and more
  nearly perfect."  But this only applies to old economy goods, right?  How do you deal with Facebook?

- P.44: NAIRU: non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, and refers to a level of unemployment below which inflation rises.  (Also, see philips curve?)

- p.47: "very high fixed costs and very low marginal costs. Such a
  pattern can produce positive feedback: Rising demand will often
  produce higher efficiency and higher returns, drives, and lower
  prices, leading to yet higher demand."  This is their thesis, right?
  It doesn't say anything about labor's share of market, only that
  entire pie will grow.

- P.48: "Ever since David Ricardo, economists have focused on
   comparative advantage as the most important reason that trade
   should be free. But it may well be that we are moving into a future
   in which these benefits are less important than those of increas-
   ing returns to scale and the extent of the market."  So, free trade
   is even more important in new economy?

- P.50: What does complement mean in "In the new economy, it is clear
  that human capital is a strong com- plement to physical capital and
  intellectual capital."  Is it opposite of substitute?

# 1/16 meeting with mark

standard argument why we shouldn't worry: productivity goes up, price
of goods go down relative to disposable income so people by more,
demand goes up and more people get employed.  This is the basic
argument by Jean-Baptiste Say is that demand will equal supply and
thus there will be no unemployment.  Of course, with the great
depression this was all called into question.  Keynes responds that
Say isn't alway right and sometime government needs to step and grease
the wheels.

(As an aside: does any connect the great depression to IR-2 - a time
of dislocation to the IR?)

Adam Smith holds that the invisible hand works when
1. No externalities
2. No public goods
3. No increasing returns to scale

- The exponential growth argument vis a vis AI

  start in 1940, still appears to be long way to go, but 2025 gets us
  more computing elements than nuerons (Doesn't actually say anything
  about AIin my opinion)

- Deal with substitution of capital at the right price of labor.
  I.e., automated lawn mower is X and lasts for 5 years.  So, if a
  person charges less than X/5 per year, then person will be
  employeed.  However, I assert that in many cases externalities will
  yield a situtation where the person would have to charge negative
  wages.  I.e., automated car.  Even if person charges zero, insurance
  of person versus automated vehicle will make it prohibitively
  expensive.

## Three parts to future of work project

### Changes are imminent and significant

Changes in technology are leading to a significant change in the
amount of labor needed for a productive society.  The result will be a
society in which structural unemployement, where employment is viewed
through today's lens, will increase significantly, i.e., less than 10%
of society will be working in a traditional sense.

The technological change is not some abrubt singularity, but rather
the inexporable march of technoligical advance in the following areas:
- computer processing, e.g., the exponential growth in operations/sec-$ (what the layman thinks of as moore's law )
- sensor/actuator technology, e.g., the exponential reduction in the cost of I/O beyond the traditional methods of keyboards, mouse, touch-screens, graphics, etc.  This expansion of I/O reaches beyond traditional methods of I/O into location (e.g., GPS), accelerometers, wireless devices, temperature sensors, compasses, touch, video, micro-motors, etc.
- networking
- MLBD (meachine learning and big data), e.g., image recognition, voice recognition, english composition, medical diagnosis, computer generated experimental science, etc.
- robotics
- 3d-printers
- synthetic biology

### Policy to make the transition smoother

- Better education K-12, undergraduate, continuing education
- art instruction
- social saftey net
- investment in R&D

### New computer mediated economies for a post-work society

- Investigate the use of "reputation" as a method of trade.  
- Eliminate fiat currencies.  
- long chained barter transactions
- value is not a scalar, but a vector

## About AI

### hard-AI versus soft-AI.

- hard-AI: Using NP-hard as a analogy, solving a hard-AI problem would
  result in solving all hard-AI problems.

- soft-AI: A particular approach to solving a problem that we thought
  required "intelligence" to solve.  For example, playing chess,
  playing Jeopardy, image recognition, etc.  These point solutions
  result in solving a problem in a particular and limited domain which
  does not extend to true intelligence.  Most recent successes have
  come from the field of Machine Learning combined with "big data."
  Maybe these point solutions could be called domain specific
  (artificial) intelligence, limited domain intelligence, statistical
  application of pattern matching.

### hard-AI not necessary for our predictions.

All of the stuff we are talking about does not need hard-AI.  In fact,
we predict that soft-AI will in and of itself lead to the creation of
machine based technological innovations which will lead to MCP==0 in
turn leading to a change in employement patterns, significant
income/wealth inequality, and the reduction in the need for human
capital.

## Possible Paper Contents

This is not an outline because I am not sure exactly how to lay this out.

- critique of previous work
  - autor
  - gordon
  - others

- Comparison to previous tech advances (AR, IR1&2)
  - they weren't so much continuous advances as one time revolutions
  - Description of previous tech revoltions
      - more vertical, then horizontal
      - previous were discontinuties, but one-time affairs
      - previous took time to disseminate and implement
      - previous created new demand which was fulfilled by new technology and human capital, MCP >>> 0.
  - Current tech advance
      - scalable: MCP < epsilon, epsilon approaches 0
      - distributed: pushes manufacturing and production to the consumer
      - smooth and continued growth (and often exponential)

- Social anecdotes
  - guttenberg and reformation, american revolution
  - are there other instances of technological advances which had signficant effect on scalability and distributedness?

- Examine Job data


# 1/9/2015 am

## Differences between previous (AR, IR1&2) and today:
- more horizontal
- scalability, e.g., MCP approaches 0
- distributedness: results in distributed production
- smooth exponential growth of technology - not a single discontinuity

## Critique of previous work
- Autor
- Gordon
- others

## How jobs change with advances of technology:
- Complementarity: (lawyer who uses Google to do legal research)
  Increases training and skills required, but also increases productivity and raise earnings

- Substitution: (buggy whips)
  Eliminates job categories entirely

- Creation: headlight manufacturing
  new job categories create new opportunities soaking up job's lost to substitution often at increased earnings

We introduce:

- Amalgamation: (lawyer who does own word processing)
  eliminates jobs (e.g., dictation), increases skills required (of
  both lawyer and secretary who remains) results in increased productivity
  and earnings for lawyer (and secretaries who remain), but eliminates jobs
  of those left behind

## Analysis of job data and technology data

### Basis set for Job catagories

- physicality: How much of the job requires interacting with the real world (e.g., plumber, nurse, driver)
- training: How much training is required to do the job (e.g., doctor, professor, musician)
- empathy: How much empathy is required to do the job (e.g, artist, psychologist, teacher)
- others?

## Economic systems:

capital v. labor:

    capital  labor  -> capitalism
    capital  !labor -> feudalism
    !capital labor  -> socialism
    !capital !labor -> What is this (and are we getting here)
